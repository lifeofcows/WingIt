Starring hunk Brendan Fraser, the film became an enormous financial success and spawned two sequels. The movie deals with a bunch of archeologists in Egypt trying to find a lost treasure, but eventually unearth a "3000 year old legacy of terror". With dazzling special efects and sweeping action segments, "The Mummuy" will satisfy those who crave films with action sequences. The DVD comes with the documentary on the making of the film called "Building A Better Look", as well as commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, and much more. WNBC-TV says, the film is a "mile-a-minute chills and thrills". A neat collectible booklet comes with the set.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>If you think this movie is to boring because it's history, your wrong!

Instead of the lumbering mummy of the old Universal films and, later in the remakes with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee for Hammer, this mummy is really something to fear.  I always thought why would anyone fear the mummy in the old films, he plods along so even a granny with a walker could outrun him!!!  As the mummy gains power, it is a very vital being with amazing powers.  The pace starts out fast, and keeps up the roller coaster ride, with AMAZING special effects.  Brilliant comedic support from John Hallam, ads to the mix of adventure, romance and mild-blowing effects.  An Absolute must!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>When this film was released in 1999, many critics bad-mouthed this movie, comparing it to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Fortunately, most of us didn't listen to them and the Mummy made almost as much as the Matrix. The comparisions are not fair, Raiders was more of an adventure movie with a serious tone, the Muumy is a homage to all the great monster flicks of the Silver Screen. <p>Incorporated in this film is plenty of humor, mostly one-liners by Brendan Frasier, who plays the swashbuckling hero out to stop the undead creature. Rachel Weisz plays the feisty heroine who is out to uncover the mythical lost city of Hamunaptra, which is said to contain the &quot;wealth of Egypt&quot;. Her brother is played by John Hannah, as her brother, who is out not for scientific gain, but for personal wealth. Frasier leads them because he was there at the city once, and is going back in search of treasure, with the funding of Weisz's character.<p>But treasure-hunting soon turns into mummy-hunting as they awaken the long-dead priest Imhotep, who is now out to restore his body and revive his deceased lover. What follows is a great mixture of horror and adventure, with some of the best special effects ever in a movie.<p>As for the DVD, the picture is excellent, even for a DVD, with terrific color representation and very good digital sound reproduction. There are a lot of extras here, too, and if you have a DVD-ROM in your computer you will be able to play a game that accompanies the disc. For DVD owners looking for a fun time with a loud movie, this is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>In the better style since Errol FLynn and Harrison Ford, this is first rate adventure movie, with humour, action, suspense and romance!  The cast is inspired (Brendan Frase is the absolute underrated  star, he can play  any role and be convincent). But it's not a movie to watch more than one  time!</p></br><a href="../users/A294DWRBQUOIK4.html">A294DWRBQUOIK4</a><br/><p>here is a movie i just love. not a brain bender by any means, but it is just pure adventure and fun. fantastic effects alot of witty lines and situations. the dvd is packed full of extras and some of them are very  interesting to watch. the digital sound is very impressive. if you want  some good old fashioned adventure then give this movie a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>This movie is a top! After seeing it in May of 1999, I was truly happy with my decision to spend my money and time on it. Full of breathtaking effects, hilarious levity and terrific performances, this movie is a  must-see for anyone who is a fan of Brendan Fraser or anyone who likes  movies that don't totally scare. This movie, along with Jan de Bont's The  Haunting, doesn't scare people out of their wits and isn't full of blood  and guts like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. The DVD release is  a winner, but not by all costs. It would be appreciated if it had a Dolby  Surround 2.0 soundtrack, but the special features deliver. In the mood for  a scare, without the bodily fluids? Try this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This 1999 blockbuster harks back to the old 40's and 50's Saturday morning matinee serials. It also, and not too discretely, does the Indiana Jones thing too. The movie is totally cartoonish. Is that bad?. Of course not. The movie was meant to be a fun, entertaining ride, and it's just that. Brendan Fraser stars as our hero who is propositioned by Egyptologist Evelyn(played by the lovely Rachel Weisz), to guide her to the lost city of Hamunaptra. The City Of The Dead. It sounds charming. Once they start digging there, they find the mummified corpse of Imhotep. He was a man who was buried alive millions of years ago because he was sleeping with the pharaoh's daughter. Even back then men didn't know better. Anywho, he is revived by a spell Evelyn accidentally reads and all hell breaks loose. He plans on resurrecting his love, which includes a lot of gore and violence. He sucks the life out of the people who were there at the dig in order to be regenerated. Oh boy, there's always a catch!. The action scenes are fun and campy. There is a nice, quirky touch of humor throughout the film that is quite funny. The effects and make-up are all good. The cast is pretty solid, if not a tad mediocre. The sets are truly wonderful and are filmed wonderfully by director Stephen Sommers. It's a highly enjoyable and entertaining 'popcorn' flick that is only to be as such. The fun was sort of lost on the overstuffed sequel. Still, this is a entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>This film started off my crush on Brendan, although he's ever so slightly losing his hair now. Arnold is lovely, he's got lovely eyes, as does Oded Fehr who plays Ardeth Bay. I could go on but I won't.<br /><br />Apart from the fact this movie's great, I also love the whole Egyptian thing portrayed in it. I love the way Anck Su Namun (played by Patricia Velasquez) dresses - or doesn't dress rather. I also love the whole black eyeliner thing, which I try in vain to copy, but can never get quite right. (Where is my own makeup artist when I need one?) With the exception of a loin cloth and a few pieces of jewelry, Patricia Velazquez's costume consists entirely of body paint which took 14 hours to apply the poor girl.<br /><br />If you listen closely during the scene where the people are chanting, the supporting artists began to change what they were chanting from the correct Egyptian phrase, to "Ohwhatanarseyouare" during rehearsals. Before long, they were all chanting it, and did so on the final take. Nobody on the crew noticed during filming, and it therefore remains in the film. I still can't hear it myself, although it is quite funny to think about it!<br /><br />Evie (Rachel Weiz) is terrific in this, and I love the way she changes from a "librarian" (complete with awful hair) into loved-up girl (with great hair!) There's so much chemistry between her & Brendan, particularly when Arnold Vosloo takes her away (ha-ha), and they're a joy to watch on screen together. John Hannah plays her brother, with a brilliant English accent, although I prefer his natural accent!<br /><br />Brendan passed out while filming because the noose around his neck was too tight. There's also a terrific scene when Arnold has him in a stranglehold, and his face does actually turn blue! (Right before they take his soul away) It also sounds like Arnold & Brendan had great fun on set as in order to practice the frightened reaction made by Arnold to Brendan with a cat, he threw a teddy bear at Vosloo which, according to Brendan, caused tremendous laughter between the two at the hilarity of being frightened at a teddy bear.<br /><br />There's loads of extras on this DVD, although most of them are quite tedious and not in the least bit interesting. (The Mummy Returns extras are even worse, they go on and on about The Rock like he's the best thing since sliced bread, even giving his character his own film!) You've got your commentaries by writer/director Stephen Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay/Brendan Fraser/Oded Fehr, Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo (no doubt all as dull as dishwater); "Building a Better Mummy": An in-depth look into the filmmaking process documentary; "Egyptology 101" Facts about ancient Egypt and Egyptian mythology; deleted scenes; visual and special effects information: A detailed look into the special effects (zzzzzzzzzzzzz); storyboard to film comparisons; photograph montage; pharaoh Lineage: A look at the pharoahs; "Spotlight on Location": Highlights on the filming of The Mummy Returns. (I ask about the latter WHY?!)<br /><br />Anyone will enjoy this movie, as long as try not to delve into the story too much. It's meant to be enjoyed, not analysed. So sit back, relax, drool over the cute guys (you'll be pleased to hear Oded Fehr gets a bigger role in the sequel). And for the guys? Drool over Patricia Velazquez in next to nothing for a couple of scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>There was already a 2-disc "Ultimate" Edition of The Mummy back in 2001, but it's no longer available.

Capturing the adventurous elements of films like "Indiana Jones" and injecting it into the basic story for the 1932 film "The Mummy", Stephen Sommers creates a terrific, enteraining film. For those interested in a synposis of the plot, I'll provide it at the end of the review because you've probably already seen this.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer looks quite good here with bold colors that more closely recall the original theatrical presentation than the DVD. The image is crisp and while there's evidently some digital noise reduction applied, Universal hasn't completely cleaned away all the film grain which is a good thing because when that's done you actually lose sharpness and clarity (it is restored with a loss of detail via Edge Enhancement like the recent reissue of "Patton" which went overboard with digitally cleaning up the film). The best thing that Universal could have done here was to leave the grain intact and dispense with the Edge Enhancement. I suspect that the same source was used for the Blu-ray as was used for the HD-DVD edition but that the Edge Enhancement is more transparent here because of higher resolution.<br /><br />What does all of that mean? The film looks extremely good but could look brilliant. Still, on the whole this looks much better than the DVD edition.<br /><br />The extras are still presented in 480p (which is standard DVD definition)so be aware those haven't been updated. However, Universal has made this a U-Control disc where you can customize the extras as you watch the film (something developed for and carried over from HD-DVD). You do get the ability to watch the visual commentary/extras while watching the film. All of the original extras from the DVD have been ported over for this edition. All of the extras and the film are on the single disc edition here (unlike the DVD which has most of the extras on a second disc).<br /><br />Followed by the equally entertaining (and much bigger production of) "The Mummy Returns" and a fun entertaining (if lesser)spin-off film "The Scorpion King", "The Mummy" is worth picking up again even if you have the original DVD edition. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Oh, and the plot? A group of explorers led by Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)and Rick (Brendan Fraiser)rush to find the riches of an Egyptian tomb and end up reviving Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo)an Egyptian High Priest buried alive for his part in a conspiracy to kill the Pharoah. Brought back by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Im-Ho-Tep takes revenge on those who plundered his tomb and seeks the Book of the Dead to bring back his beloved princess who helped him kill the Pharoah.<br /><br />It is a great popcorn flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>How could anyone not enjoy this movie. If there was an academy award for &quot;most enjoyable movie of the year&quot; this would win hands down. Brandan  was perfectly cast as the gung-ho hero and rachel was great as the  beautiful love interest. (and beautiful she is) just like his less  sucessful but(in my books) equally enjoyable &quot;Deep Rising&quot;,  Steven Sommers trades horror in for fun thrills. The Mummy is a perfect  action movie and the DVD version shows you can improve on perfection.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I must admit, I was a little skeptical when this movie first came out. But after watching it, I have to say. WHAT MORE DID YOU WANT!!!!!, this movie delivers in more ways than one. In response to one reviewer, I've seen the original Mummy movie, woooooooooooooow, I had a hard time trying to keep from getting bored. All they did, was update the movie, story and all. This time the Mummy is actually scary, he actually looks like he came back from the dead. And the scarabs, they are a character in this movie all by themselves. Surprise surprise surprise, when you give Brendan Fraser a very good script, and don't ask him to do too much. He's a very good actor, there is chemistry between him and Rachel weisz. The only update on the story, is that instead on Imhotep falling in love with A queen named Anucksananum, it's the pharoe's mistress. I won't rehash the plot, I like the fact that Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'connell as a man of action. It's not even close to boring, I enjoyed this movie. It was well written, well directed, and very well acted.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>I enjoy watching great action movies and this has plenty of it.  The plot is almost the same as the classic Mummy story.  Ancient Egyptian Priest has forbidden love, Priest gets caught, priest gets tongue cut off and cursed for eternity, Priest comes back to life as a Mummy 3000 years later, havoc ensues.  What makes this movie different are the outstanding special effects, good acting, and great action.  Brendon Fraser is the hero, Rachel Weisz is the love interest and Arnold Vosloo is "IMHOTEP" the Mummy!!  This is a great action movie that is worth watching on a rainy day when you can't go outside.  The Mummy returns is an excellent sequel as well.  Great fun that is recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>The Special Effects are weak by today's standards, but not particularly bad. This is because they never let the fact that they can do fantastic things in CG distract them from crafting a fun action story with likable characters. The effects are sufficient for their purpose and do not distract.<br />That being said, the real draw here is the character of the movie. Not the characters on their own, though they are fun too. But the character of the movie. It aims to be a fun action adventure and it achieves that very nicely. There are a couple bits (primarily around a couple of the victims of the mummy's attacks and regeneration) that can be a bit disturbing to the very young, so just know that it earns its PG-13 rating. But beyond that, there is very little here that is particularly objectionable.<br />A fun ride that leaves you feeling good at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>Originally, The Mummy genre was typically a horror film, but this revised version, adds, action, adventure, with a blend of light hearted drama. The result, is a satisfying, and entertaining film, in the style of the Indiana Jones films. With good visual effects, and characterizations.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Another favorite franchise of mine, the movies just never fail to deliver. In this, probably the "scariest" out of the three, we have the prologue that explains Imhotep's backstory and motivations then jump to Brendan Fraser's (another favorite actor of mine) character with the French Foreign Legion defending the City of the Dead in 1923 then jump another three years where we're introduced to Rachel Weisz's character and the rest of the story. A remake, and I use the term loosely, of the 1932 classic, so some story elements remain the same. Imhotep however gets an upgrade. From a walking corpse to his fully regenerated self, he possesses super-human abilities and can summon the ten plagues of Egypt. Fraser and Weisz have a chemistry together reminiscent, I think anyway, of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg of The Avengers. John Hannah as Weisz's greedy brother Jonathan and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, O'Connell's cowardly "friend" are the comic relief in this but are nonetheless entertaining. Arnold Vosloo is great as Imhotep, ably conveying a sense of menace and tortured romance. A small bit part of a retired RAF Col., Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay from Bewitched) is funny and charming when he talks about not going down in a blaze of glory like his comrades. The effects and action sequences are top-notch, the mummy effects being brilliantly done by ILM. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a great swashbuckling score that also manages to deliver, like Imhotep, a sense of menace.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition) is a great adventure movie that is a bit like the Indiana Jones movies but with a mummy. Acting and plot are ok but one sees this movie for the action scenes and the special effects. The music is quite good also. This movie is nothing like Mummy with Boris Karloff and if one expects it to be the same then one will be sorely disapointed. However, if one comes in and expects a thin action driven plot with plenty of special effects then this is a dandy of a movie. 4/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Egyptian priest Imhotep was mummified alive and cursed after killing Pharaoh Seti and sleeping with his intended fiancee. In 1923, treasure hunters Rick O'Connell (Fraser), Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz), and Jonathan Carnahan (Hannah) accidentally set him free.  It's up to the intrepid trio -- with a little help from their friends -- to set things right before the Mummy destroys the world.  You've got a good deal of action and adventure with some serious romance thrown in, too.<br /><br />If you don't mind the slash and burn style archeology from "Indiana Jones" with a lower ick factor and a bit more comedy, you'll enjoy "The Mummy."<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, August 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>This was such a fun movie to watch. I can remember when I first heard Brendan Fraser (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304711867">George of the Jungle</a>) was starring in it I questioned whether I wanted to see it but I am SO glad I did. As good as it is on a small screen it was outstanding to watch on the large. Even though it's barely over two hours you almost left the theater exhausted.<br /><br />Fraser plays fortune hunter Rick O'Connell, a man motivated by treasure but also very loyal to his friends & partners. Rachel Weisz (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C65Z1G">The Constant Gardener (Widescreen Edition)</a>) plays Evie, a librarian whose specialty is ancient Egyptian artifacts. John Hannah (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305210411">Sliding Doors</a>) plays her brother Jonathan, a less than scrupulous want-to-be archeologist/fortune-hunter who, contrary to a review in the New Yorker Magazine, is not a "dim but cowardly..." character. To me, Hannah's portrayal of Jonathan is one of the surprising gems of the film. Always looking for the quick-fix but willing to stand up for his sister. But the one character that steals almost every scene he's in is Arnold Vosloo's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MZHW40">Blood Diamond (Widescreen Edition)</a>) "Imhotep", otherwise known as the mummy.<br /><br />The premise is Evie (with a little not-so-legal help from her brother) discovers the location of the lost treasure city of Hamunaptra. Upon arriving she reads from the "book of the dead", releasing the mummy, who plans to resurrect his lost love and then pretty much rain disaster over the whole world. And of course, he needs to sacrifice Evie to do it. It's up to O'Connell & Jonathan with help from a descendent of the ancient Pharaoh guards to rescue her and kill the Mummy before he can unleash his terror.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. The actors play off each other wonderfully. The plot, while hokey at times is a blast to follow, especially because the filmmakers never take it too seriously. The special effects are outstanding, not only for 1999 standards, but holds up well even now. And the soundtrack is a perfect fit, never over-powering a scene. Overall, just a great film to escape into for two hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KN7BIG">The Mummy Returns [HD DVD</a>]) never lived up to this film. Although it used the same blueprint, the plot quickly slipped from unbelievable (OK for this type of film) to ludicrous (a death sentence). But with the new film (The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  [Blu-ray]) being released this summer I am hopeful for a return to greatness, or at least a return to enjoyability. My only reservation is that Rachel Wiesz was unable to reprise her role as Evie. Let's hope her replacement, Maria Bello (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTRKE">World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)</a>), is as good.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>The Mummy is high quality entertainment.  It does a great job of entertaining, that's saying something.  Some movies can't even do that.  But this succeeds on all levels.<br /><br />It's a great popcorn flick.

"The Mummy" is definitely one of those right movies.  From the opening credits to the first views of the Egyptian city, the clarity of the high-def presentation rivals that of your local theater.  Once a wall-sized monitor becomes available, film buffs are truly going to be able to have the theater experience right in their own homes.<br /><br />The action sequences are great.  The colors are fantastic.  And the special effects are tremendous.  The dust cloud confrontation at the end just blew me away all over again.<br /><br />I owned the movie on DVD and had watched it on television a few times (it's one of those on a list of guilty pleasures) but I hadn't seen anything like this presentation outside of the theater.<br /><br />Now I gotta get "The Mummy Returns" and "The Scorpion King."

Some might not like that, but I do.  It brought back memories of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, of course thats what it meant to do.  I loved the dialoge.  It was funny and a bit cheesy, but again thats how this was supposed to be.<br /><br />The effects are great for a 99' movie.  The mummy looked completely realistic.  The acting was great, especially from Fraser.<br /><br />Overall if you want a comedy movie get this.  If you want an action movie, get this.

Brendan Fraser ("George Of The Jungle") is an Indiana Jones-type soldier-turned archeologist when a librarian (Rachel W.), due to her brother's (John Hannah) greed, accidentally stumbles upon a map revealing the location of an ancient city. The trail leads them to Egypt, where...I won't say anymore. The sequel is just as entertaining, as well as the prequel (which Sommers didn't direct, but stayed on as producer). All three films should have been rated PG for action-violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>This movie is a perfect example of how films ought to be done.  A good script, a sensible plot, and flawless casting make this film a surprising classic.  Even the subplots were gems--although you see Captain Havlock (Bernard Fox) for three scenes, he is a lively supporting character with his own soul and story.<br /><br />Fraser was able to pull off a credible Indiana Jones-type character, while still maintaining his own adolescent playfulness.  I am glad that the directors and the producers let Brendan be Brendan, and thus differentiating this film form the other 1930's era films:  The Phantom, the Shadow, and Sky Captain.<br /><br />This film is a delightful mixture of seriousness and comedy, horror and humor, capped off by tongue in cheek playfulness--reminiscent of the Ghostbusters or Kolchack.<br /><br />There are only two drawbacks to this film. The first is that they went a little too wild with some of the CGI, specifically the slack-jaw expression of the mummies.  It looks funny the first time, but is too hokey.  They keep their shape, but do show some yellowing with age.<br /><br />The other issue is why they called this The Mummy.  The Boris Karloff classic is it's own thing, and bears a superficial resemblance to this film.  As a fan of black and white films, it certainly would have cleared up things if I could talk about the Golden Age of Horror film without confusing the uninitiated.  Then again, if you do not call the film The Mummy, what would you call it?</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the late 90's, Universal Studios decided it was time to dust off their famous monsters of old, and give them a face-lift in order to give thrills and chills to the new generation of moviegoers that never experienced them during their peak.  To accomplish this task, Universal tapped a relatively unknown director named Stephen Sommers to rejuvenate their famous monster the mummy.  So, with basically a rookie director, a lofty budget, and a decently big name star in Brendan Fraser, Universal put a lot of faith and clout behind their remake of "The Mummy".  But one problem still remains with this remake, can it possibly impress the older generation that grew up on the original, and can it muster enough thrills for the newer, more jaded generation?<br /><br />"The Mummy" is the story of a 3,000 year old force of terror being unleashed upon Egypt.  The mummy (Arnold Vosloo) is a former Egyptian priest named Imhotep, who betrayed the pharoah when he struck up an affair with the pharoah's wife, and as punishment both Imhotep and his love were placed in a cursed tomb where they would forever remain.  That is until a team of explorers lead by Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) accidentally release the monster upon Egypt.  As if the monster wasn't enough to deal with, Egypt is bombarded by plagues of Biblical proportion that seem to follow the mummy wherever he goes.  Can Rick and Evie save Egypt from the mummy's wrath, or will they become part of his unwitting legion of zombies?  Time will tell.<br /><br />Though expectations for "The Mummy" were decent, there was still plenty of skepticism surrounding the possible success of the remake.  Earlier I posed the question that was present in many people's minds in regards to this film, could this remake even hope to equal the original film and impress both old and new generations of moviegoers?  The answer, a resounding yes for both.  Based on huge box office numbers and critical praise, it was clear that Universal's gamble to resurrect their monsters of old was not a mistake.  With the success of the film, actors Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz were propelled to super-stardom, and it wasn't long before the offers started rolling in.  The two lead actors weren't the only ones benefiting from the huge success of "The Mummy", director Stephen Sommers showed off his knack for special effects extravaganzas, and found himself in charge of a budding new franchise for Universal Studios, not a bad way to boost a career.  Alongside the live actors in the film, the special effects team at George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, were given the daunting task of creating a realistic-looking CGI mummy.  No small task by any means, but the creative team pulled it off stunningly, along with the CGI creation of the mummy, ILM handled all of the special effects work for the film, all with outstanding results by the way.  For a remake, an all to common theme in Hollywood these days, Universal sure chose wisely and managed to avoid the most common pitfall of remakes, the fact that most can't even come close to matching the original in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly "The Mummy" is the exception to what has long been the rule.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good blockbuster movie with plenty of humor, thrills, and even a few chills, then do yourself a favor and watch this enjoyable film that rejuvenated the Hollywood monster movie genre and started a franchise in the process.<br /><br />"The Mummy" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>If you think "The Mummy" is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again. "The Mummy" of 1999 is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) flick as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.<br /><br />Everything magically works in "The Mummy" granting us a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene -- it's a hoot). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah grants some highly comedic moments as Rachael's brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasle.<br /><br />"The Mummy" is not great ponderous art as in, say, "Apocalypse Now" or "2001: A Space Odyssey," but it is great adventure and horrific fun. On that level it's film-making of the highest order!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This would have to be one of my favourite Horror  movies. It stars Brendan Fraser in a role reminiscent of Harrison Ford in the Indian Jones Movies but this movie is set in Egypt where an Ancient Mummy has returned to life and must be distroyed. Brendan is joined in his hunt by the beautiful Rachel Weisz with a very sexy English accent. I only wish the my local Librarian looked as good as her. A thrilling chase, a few unexpecte twists and the good guys put up one hell of a fight?

The fact that the film was set in the 1920's, the decade when King Tut's glorious tomb was discovered, rather than modern times boosts The Mummy's authenticity and effectiveness.<br /><br />The movie opens in ancient Egypt, where the Pharaoh's most powerful and trusted priest, Imhotep is carrying on a passionate affair with his boss's beloved mistress, played by the jaw-droppingly hot Patricia Velasquez.  The lovebirds murder the Pharaoh, but are caught.  Ahnk Sunamun plunges a sword into her belly, and Imhotep is sentenced to the worst punishment of all.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 1923.  The nerdy but lovely Evie (Rachel Weisz) is a cryptologist and specialist in ancient Egyptian.  She saves rakish adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) from hanging, and together with her brother set out to find the legendary city of Hamunaptra.  They are dogged by competition, other adventurers seeking the fabled city and its treasure.  Unbeknownst to them, they are watched by the Med Jai warriors, sworn to make sure Amun Hotep is never accidentally awakened by any of these adventurers.<br /><br />Well, needless to say, the evil creature is awakened by the bumbling adventurers, releasing the plagues of Egypt on the population, and seeking to make them his slaves.  How will Imhotep - now the Mummy - be stopped?<br /><br />Two minor characters add so much to the film.  The smoldering and athletic Oded Fehr as Med Jai warrior Arded Bey, and the hilarious Omid Djalili as an unscrupulous and oversexed prison warden.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>I remember my dad taking me to see this movie in spring of 1999 when I was in 8th grade, and it had me awake all night thinking a mummy would come!

It rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Mummy is a WONDERFUL movie, set during the interwar period in Egypt, dealing with the adventures of an unlikely group that has banded together for a variety of reasons in exploring the lost City of the Dead-Hamunaptra.<br />The acting is very good, the costumes are extraordinary, and the plot is GREAT! The Mummy successfully combines adventure, horror, humour and romance, but what really steals the show is the "villains" who had me rooting for them throughout the whole movie.<br />There is a very strong element of archaeology and mythology; what with the lost City of the Dead, the Gold Book of Life and the Black book of death, the gods Anubis and Horus etc.<br />Deserts, Pyramids, Heroes, and Villains are all about...<br />Strongly recommended to those who are fascinated with archaeology and history, especially those with a keen interest in Ancient Egypt.  It is a definite "must see" together with the sequel The Mummy Returns, as well as the Scorpion King and Stargate, which also fall into the same category of movies, theme-wise.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>The Mummy is full of action and adventure as well as good acting.  Usually I find when films are shot in the desert the plot gets old and boring (ex. Hidalgo) but not this film.  This has a little Indiana Jones and a little bit of Alien mixed in.  It is a really good popcorn movie.  One thing I have to say is that I think they could've got a better actor for the lead role instead of Brenden Frazier.  The british girl played a good role.  The special effects were awesome and the story really grabs you.  See this or rent it.  I highly reccomend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>In ancient Egypt, one priest had the nerve to fall in love with Pharaoh's mistress.  As a penalty, he was cursed to become one of the undead and suffer for all time.  Unless someone released him from his prison.<br /><br />Flash forward to the 1920's.  A group of treasure hunters and a group of archeologists set out to find the ancient city of Hamunaptra.  When they accidentally awaken the ancient evil, they find themselves in a race against time to save their own skin and the world in general.  Is there a way to stop someone you can't kill?<br /><br />This movie starts out rather slow.  The first hour is set up getting the characters to the city.  Once the Mummy awakens, however, it becomes a fast paced thrill ride you can't stop watching.  The actors do a great job of keeping things believable, even if the plot has a few holes in it.<br /><br />The DVD truly has some great stuff on it.  Not only do you get great picture and sound with wide screen and full surround, but you get some fun features, too.  The director's audio commentary is fascinating, discussing the struggles that it took to get the movie to the screen.  Along those lines, the documentary is fantastic as well.  I always love seeing what goes into making movie magic.  Also worth checking out is the section on ancient Egypt.<br /><br />This movie is slightly horror, but mainly action/adventure.  It's a Saturday matinee, popcorn flick with great special effects.

Reflecting upon the many great action/adventure movies of the nineties brings me to the conclusion that this silver screen phenomenon must be listed among the top five to ten films of the nineties.  Of course this is evidenced by its overwhelming box office receipts and DVD sales.  The odd thing for me was that due to a heavy work schedule and limited time, I never even saw a trailer for this great movie and thus didn't afford myself the opportunity to see it in the theaters!  This oversight was of course corrected with its sequel, "The Mummy Returns."<p>The stars - Given Brendan Frasier's past films I never would've ever expected him to make such an outstanding action/adventure star as he is with his performance in this film.  It almost seems as if the role of swashbuckling adventurer Rick O'Connell was created for him and him alone.  Then there's the ever beautiful and gorgeous Rachel Weisz starring as "Evy" or Evelyn whose performance in this film is dead on perfect as the librarian/adventurer.  Arnold Vosloo performs perfectly in the role of the Mummy.<p>One might think that a film of this nature might fall short on plot while being heavy on the action; this is simply not the case with "The Mummy."  The film moves along fluidly with a great amount of attention centered on the plot and supported perfectly by the comedic moments and the seamless CGI provided by ILM, the masters of the CGI domain.<p>I don't normally comment on the director but in this case I feel almost compelled to state that director and author of the screenplay, Stephen Sommers "must" be commended for bringing this outstanding story to fruition for it is simply a brilliant piece of work.  In "The Mummy" he has most certainly created the latest and greatest big budget, heavy action film series that can easily be compared to the Indiana Jones films, using those as a benchmark.<p>The premise:<p>The film opens with a superb opening sequence some three thousand years ago as we're taken to ancient Egypt in the year 1290 B.C. and shown the circumstances of how the High Priest Imhotep ended up being the Mummy through his and Anck Su Namun's treachery against Pharaoh Seti.  After his treachery, he attempts to resurrect Anck Su Namun in Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the Pharaoh's guards catch him and he is mummified.<p>Scrolling forward to the year 1926 and we meet our erstwhile heroes who through their chance meeting are on an adventure to find Hamunaptra.  While the majority of the group is searching for hidden treasure, Evy is looking for more...  Unfortunately for them and fortunately for us, she finds more and what follows is as stated above, one of the best action/adventure movies of the nineties and probably the best of this type since the last Indiana Jones film.<p>I highly recommend this film for all its merits; it is a great film that is fun and extraordinarily enjoyable.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Building A Better Mummy - This is an outstanding special highlighting what everybody involved in making the film wanted to do as far as not making a film fraught with many a clich&eacute;, harkening one back to the older films.<p>Feature Commentary<br />Visual and special effects formation<br />Egyptology 101<br />Deleted scenes<br />Theatrical trailers<br />Universal showcase</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>The Mummy  DVD<br /><br />The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weise is a rousing remake of the 1932 horror film classic which had some people who are innocently exploring the Sahara Desert,  unwittingly releasing a priest who had defiled Pharaoh's woman.

Remember the bugs.  This priest is inadvertently awaken and goes around trying to collect the vital organs of his human contacts.  One by one the priest acquires these "vital organs".<br /><br />This movie has the flavor of the Indiana Jones movies, music, characters, etc.  It could easily have been called "Indiana Jones and the Lost Sarcophagus, but that would have landed the makers in court for a copyright infringement.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the Indiana Jones aficionada.<br /><br />Gunner  December, 2007</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>"The Mummy" is not a mere remake, because although it's slightly based in the 1932 movie, this version is completely different, the special effects in 1999 were sufficiently advanced to make a spectacular movie. And in my opinion, the remakes should be done this way, writing new stories, adding more things, but respecting the original idea. When Hollywood tries to make a remake step by step, it usually is a fatal mistake, just take a look to "Psycho (1998)", it's a lame version of Hitchcock's original version.<br /><br />"The Mummy" is one of the quintessential summer movies of recent years, it's fast paced, it has amazing special effects, it has humor, it has colorful characters, and it has a beautiful heroine Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz), a brave girl that combines charm, exotic beauty and courage. The hero John Hannah (played by Brendan Fraser) is a combination of Indiana Jones and George Of The Jungle.<br /><br />Fraser doesn't have the typical physical aspect of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Eastwood or Ford, but he does a good job in "The Mummy", and it's a welcome change to the typical movie hero. The movie has a lot of interesting visual effects, specially when Imhotep uses the sand to create a giant version of his face.<br /><br />"The Mummy" loses some steam when it becomes too repetitive in some scenes, but overall this is entertainment, and it's noticeable that the director, the cast and the crew of "The Mummy" made a modern version of an old movie with good results. A very amusing movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>This tale includes imaginative effects such as mummies coming to life while still mummies, gradually becoming fleshed-out again, and taking the flesh of others to complete the process. The mummies are also capable of causing and leading sandstorms against their adversaries. The figures present in hieroglyphics can come alive and step out of them.  Dung beetles are presented as vicious, flesh-eating beetles that crawl under the skin of their victims, and attack in hordes. Magic incantations, when read out of a secret book, can change everything.<br /><br />Three thousand years ago, an Egyptian priest touched a woman who belonged to the pharaoh. The priest was punished by getting embalmed alive, with flesh-eating beetles devouring his flesh. The pharaoh's wealth was hidden in the area, and it became the subject of centuries of speculation, storytelling, and efforts to locate it.<br /><br />The protagonists of this story manage to find the hidden city (Hamunaptra), which has long been dismissed as fantasy. The stories about pharaoh's wealth are also true. But then they have to tangle with the mummy of the long-ago slain priest who takes their flesh in his efforts to become a fleshed-out human once again.

The plot-line is pretty well-known; explorers and treasure hunters disturb a mummy's tomb, and he comes back to seek revenge. Only now instead of a man wrapped in bandages, we get sleek, sexy, bald Arnold Vosloo in robes and enhanced by computer graphics. And instead of the plastic, gung-ho hero we get the very likeable Brendan Fraser.<br /><br />The Mummy is a pretty fun film from a relatively undistinguished director. If you dig the romanticized, Indiana Jones-style adventuring with laid back heroes and fiesty female leads (Rachel Weisz), this is a great movie to check out. The cast is having lots of fun, the script packs in lots of good comedy bits and action setpieces, and the CG effects are handled well. They went a little overboard with the sequel and packed in too much of everything there, but this first installment is a nicely contained film.<br /><br />There are two editions, the regular collector's package and another 2-disc ultimate package. The ultimate set doesn't add that much except for commentaries and a look at the sequel (now useless), and also loses the isolated score bonus feature. This single disc can also be found in the Mummy 3-pack that collects all the movies together. Whichever version you pick, The Mummy is a solid adventure flick thats good for repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>The emotional equivalent of eating a MRE when you're starving to death- that is The Mummy.  Boris Karloff's "The Mummy" was remade in 2001 into The Mummy, starring Brendan Frasier. This is the sequel and is so much better than the original. The basic plot: some evil Arab dudes have resurrected Imhotep, chief royal advisor to long-gone Egyptian pharaoh Seti I, in order to power him up enough to take out a bad-ass known as the Scorpion King (played magnificently by The Rock)- and of course, Evie and her husband (Frasier) must kill either the Scorpion King or Imhotep to prevent the other from taking over the world. The DVD is definitely your best choice for this flick; the VHS and DVD contain the same movie but the DVD has much better quality visuals and a hell of a lot more special material. (Unfortunately, only the VHS version has the music video for "Forever May Not Be Long Enough" by Live [a song from the soundtrack and a perfect pick, in my opinion]). I leave you with these words spoken by Ardeth Bay (played finely by Oded Fehr), the family guardian: "My friend, there is a fine line between coincidence and faith." From a movie containing quite a bit of Christian material, this line is a perfect addition to an already great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>I just rented this movie a few days ago and watched it.

Only when they get there, trouble immediately starts. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan carelessly resurrects the mummy of Imhotep when Evelyn reads from 'the book of the dead'.

And I have a good imagination... Don't get me wrong, it WAS scary and suspenseful, yet there were plenty of funny parts which I was laughing so hard I was crying! I was actually impressed by Brendan Fraser's acting, too. I've seen him play in some really dumb movies like &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; and &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; so I didn't know what to expect from him playing in an adventure movie. And he did a great job! This is a good movie to watch while eating popcorn at night with the lights turned off at home. I really want to try to get this DVD.

That is to have fun! It isn't made to be taken serious. People down The Mummy and its awesome sequel for being filled with special effects and witty humour. I say, bring it on! The special effects in The Mummy were very interesting. Most were convincing, and breathtaking. Such as the recreation of Ancient Egypt, and the sand-wall. The watery spirit that went into Anck Su Namun was kind of campy, but fit into the movie. The casting was also great. Brendan Fraser was awesome as our hero, Rick O Connell. Fraser did well with his dialogue and actions, and was good with the one-liners. His reactions were funny too. Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Her character, Evelyn, went from being very clumsy (a cute scene) to being very brave (her face-off with mummified Anck Su Namun). John Hannah (Jonathan) was our comic relief, and so was Kevin J. O'Conner who played the wimpy Beni. Oded Fehr made a good co-hero, and Arnold Voosloo was the villian, the mummy. Voosloo has the creepiest eyes, so that fit well with his character. As for the dvd itself, picture and audio are great. I think the deleted scenes should've been kept in as to they were interesting, and added more action and suspense. But I guess they took them out for length. The rest of the supplements were interesing.

Brendan Fraser hams it up delightfully as the roguish ex-legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is roped in (forgive the dreadful pun!) into helping Egyptologist Evelyn played by Rachel Weisz to locate the lost city of Hamunaptra and its many wonderful treasures.  Unfortunately Hamunaptra has many secrets, some of them very, very nasty and the nastiest secret of all is the evil priest Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo.  I have to admit Arnold Vosloo made the film for me, as did the young woman who played the Pharaoh's mistress and his lover, Patricia Velazquez, she was superb, shame she had such a small part in the film!  The special effects were amazing, and the humour rib chucklingly funny.  I mean who can forget the moment when Imhotep's still decomposing body falls out of the coffin and Rick, Evelyn and her brother Jonathan played stupendously by John Hannah look at each other and say simultaneously, "he's still so.......JUICY!"  I howled with both laughter and fright.  This is a great film with some gruesome moments but mostly in my opinion this is a comedy of horrors that makes you both jump and laugh in fright.  I won't give away anymore of the plot but it is worth seeing and a double disc compellation special makes it twice as good.

The 1932 horror classic featuring Boris Karloff gets a thrilling remake with a strong cast headed by Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Voslo, and John Hannah, much enhanced by the latest in computer-generated imagery.<br /><br />The movie opens with the story of Imhotep (a nicely menacing Arnold Voslo), an Egyptian priest caught by the Pharoah violating one of his concubines.  Imhotep's murder of the Pharoah draws him the horrible living death of entombment in a coffin full of flesh-eating bugs, at Hamanatra, the City of the Dead.<br /><br />The story flashes forward to a French Foreign Legion unit under attack by Arab raiders at the same location a few millenia later. The leader of the Legionaires, an American named Rick O'Connell (played with suitable swagger by Brendan Fraser) survives the massacre and escapes across the desert.<br /><br />The story jumps now to a museum in Cairo, where Evie (played with equal parts brains and klutziness by Rachel Weisz), a female Egyptologist, is researching the mysteries of the now legendary Hamanatra.  Her never-do-well, cowardly, but likeable brother Jonathan (John Hannah) surfaces with an artifact that is the key to the mystery.  The two decide to find the City of the Dead.<br /><br />Rachel hires Rick to guide them across the desert, after first rescuing him from the hangman's noose in a Cairo jail.  The three, accompanied by Rick's erstwhile jailer, travel by river steamer and camel, racing a competing team of archeologists and tracked by a mysterious group of avengers who seek to prevent them from reaching Hamanatra.  At Hamanatra, our heroes uncover the "Book of the Dead" and accidentally resurrect Imhotep.  The stage is set for a wild series of adventures, as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan are pursued back to Cairo by Imhotep, then must follow him back to Hamanatra to rescue Evie.<br /><br />The movie manages to be a nice combination of thrilling action broken up by moments of comedy.  Much of the story is a tongue-in-cheek homage to earlier adventure classics.  If the dialogue is sometimes cliched, the action steps along quickly enough to avoid boring the viewer.  The sets are authentic looking, and the movie score nicely accents the action.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as first rate entertainment.  This DVD version has some nice extra features on the special effects and Egyptology 101.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This movie turned out to be very entertaining.

A huge box-office success in the summer that gave us The Matrix and The Phantom Menace in 1999, this action- adventure is big on action, great SFX and witty laughs. Taking ideas from other films (Indiana Jones), it nonetheless is a cracking adventure tale that starts off great and builds up with a huge string of sequences and set pieces. <p>Sommers, who gave us The Jungle Book (1995) and Deep Rising (1998) gets a bigger budget, some great ideas and impressive SFX creations. Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weiz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah, The Mummy is great pocorn- munching entertainment, with some amusing, well-timed humour and great action set pieces. Watching a CGI Mummy seek vengeance on the group who wake him up is so much fun. However, the story tends to get silly, and the script is rather wooden. And the film, inevitably, spawned the inferior The Mummy Returns. Sequels notwithstanding, it's a B movie with an A grade budget and a top cast, and the DVD is packed with tons of extras on the making of the film. Good fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A23XVF23C7BHP0.html">A23XVF23C7BHP0</a><br/><p>Whatever you think of the movie (and I loved it!) this DVD is the best I have seen (and I have about 100). It is packed to the brim with extras, including the best type of commentary by director and designer, and mini features on the making of the movie, special effects, and even web-page equivalents (although viewable through your DVD player and not requiring a computer) on Egyptology and Egyptian artefacts. I would recommend any electronics shop hoping to sell some DVD players invests in a copy of The Mummy because it shows how good the format can be when used to its full potential. Turning to the film, this was a loving re-creation of the 1930s Universal horror movie, yet updated to 1990s standards. In Arnold Vosloo the film has an effective monster, and comparisons with Karloff are unfair. Rachel Weisz is the sort of beautiful actress that appeals to both men and women for different reasons, and funnily enough, George Of The Jungle star Brendan Fraser shows that that film was just an embarrassing hiccup and that he does have talent after all. And of course, the girls love him! The beauty of the desert long shots is matched by the attention to detail in the CGI effects, which shows how effects can enhance a film without making it seem (Terminator II?) like a lot of effects strung together in a loose plot. The fighting skeletons are reminiscent of the best Ray Harryhausen stop-motion work, and it would be good to see more of them in the sequel! There's a lovely scene at the beginning of the movie where a whole room full of bookshelves is 'domino-toppled'. This seems predictable but this sort of corniness is excusable in that it introduces the characters and gives us a contrast with the later action. A lovely film made by a dedicated director and a talented cast, and probably the best DVD made to date.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>...with modern day special effects.  The Mummy is definitely a throwback to the old horror movies of the 40s and 50s.  Thankfully updated with excellent special effects as well as humor and fast paced action.  It's an adventure movie, nothing more.  Brendan Fraser is a blast to watch as dual pistol packing, attitude slapping, down to earth ex-Legionnaire who finds himself teaming up with a couple of geeky librarian siblings, one of which happens to be the beautiful Rachael Weisz.  Fraser's character is hired by the two because he has seen something no one else has, the grave site of the lost city of Hamunaptra that holds the tomb of Imhotep, a powerful high priest in the days of the greatest and richest Pharaoh.  What follows is a semi complex adventure that keeps you hanging and keeps you entertained.  There are definitely some creepy moments and some aspects are intriguing, specifically the burials and rituals of the ancient Egyptians.  Some aspects are of course, stretched and unrealistic, but you can't expect Oscar material from some thing like this, who in their right mind would?  But The Mummy is a great piece of movie work and the DVD is full of extra features, so it is well worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When THE MUMMY first came out all my friends told me it was a really good movie that reminded them of Indiana Jones. When I finally first watched this film, I was let down. It seemed to me to be a poor imitation of the Indy films. However, after watching it several times since then, I have come to enjoy the movie much more.<p>Brendan Fraser's O'Connel starts off as an Indy wannabe. However, by the time the final credits role, he has become his own character. Much of the plot is taken from Universal's orignial THE MUMMY, but this time instead of a Mummy who strangles people to death, the Mummy sucks out the life from his victims and spews forth plagues from his mouth. The special effects are magnificient and though the acting is a bit cheesy, one must not forget that this is not a dramatic masterpiece. The movie is filled with humor, taking away from some of the more gruesome points in the film.  Overall, the tongue-in-cheek revamp of the original THE MUMMY, along with the great special effects make this fun movie a tasty piece of mind-candy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>THis movie is a good action/comedy thriller.
