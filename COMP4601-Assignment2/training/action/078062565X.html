"I haven't been the same since," the special effects wizard of "Jason and the Argonauts" and "Mysterious Island" says. "That shows how a film can change a whole life sometimes." Harryhausen figures he's watched the 1933 classic something like 175 times -- "You see something different in it every time you run it." For his 176th screening, DVD viewers are invited to listen in.<br /><br />On the DVD debut of "King Kong," Harryhausen and younger colleague Ken Ralston ("The Polar Express") spin a relaxed and often delightful commentary. At times they're experts dissecting the groundbreaking effects work; then they just seem like youngsters awed by the giant ape's sound and fury. The restored "King Kong" contains the 4 1/2 minutes that were censored as too risque or violent -- scenes such as the one in which Kong tears away some of Faye Wray's clothes. Or his size-98 foot doing the monster mash on an islander.<br /><br />The main nitrate print used for the restoration and transfer came from Britain, where "Kong" apparently roamed unmolested. The black-and-white images look sensational coming from a film that's almost 75 years old. The mono sound delivers the roars, screams and pounding drums without age-related distortion. The "Kong" DVD, with its generous suite of bonus features, completes a circle of sorts -- Criterion's laserdisc of 1985 was one of the first videos to include commentary and onscreen extras.<br /><br />The highlight, aside from the still potent 1933 film, is a chronicle of Peter Jackson's reconstruction of  legendary lost "spider pit" sequence -- the missing link in the "Kong" tale. Unlike other fans, he was in the position to resurrect it -- which the director did as a side project, "purely for fun," as he started production on the new "Kong." The set's docu "RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World," is well worth the time investment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot;.

This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. Watch both the black and white original, as well as the later colorized version. I am sure that you will agree with me that, while the colorized version is a curiosity to be viewed, when available, the black and white original is the way to go. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>I first watched this movie when I was about 7 years old. After watching it I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I mean, for a black and white movie... oh man. It's as good today as it was when I first watched it, and I've watched it many times in between. Highly recommended for lovers of old time classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>It is not a stretch to say that every imaginative film since KING KONG owes everything to this breakthrough film.  Not in the least.  This is the first film of this type to have a huge impact -- not just with movie goers of the time but future generations -- in inspiring countless generations.  An incredible retelling of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST with it's poetic last lines, "It was beauty that killed the beast."  It -- despite progression by leaps and bounds in special visual effects -- remains a monumental achievement, one that Willis O'Brien would never achieve again.  Yet he did inspire so many generations of young people who saw the incredible wonder and dream of doing it themselves: Ray Harryhausen, Jim Danforth, David Allen, Jim Apeaperle (?), Roger Dickens, Ken Ralston, Doug Trumbill and too many others to name.  With stop motion O'Brien was able to give Kong life and emotion.  If you love fantastic films this has to be a cornerstone of any library.  Remastered to probably better than viewers saw it on the silver screen of the time and with insighful commentary by Harryhausen and Ralston, you have to love this movie.  It has been loving remastered for future generations.  Peter Jackson launched a HUGE remake that has some true moments but nothing can ever exceed the original.  Kong battling a T-Rex is still exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>To be perfectly honest, I always have mixed reactions about all three King Kong films: the original 1933 version, the 1976 remake, and the 2005 remake. I love 2005's special effects and the perfected image of the giant ape, but having it set in '33 again didn't make it all very special. I found Grodin's performance in 1976 very over-the-top, but the chemistry between girl and ape really improved. Now with 1933, it's also a mixed bag. Yes, it's am absolute classic and it brought an entire galaxy of upcoming monster movies. Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot gave terrific performances. The music is authentically primitive. The special effects are still spectacular and revolutionary, even if they do look very outdated in our modern time. But why did I give this movie four stars instead of five? Well, it's because, since it was still a very early time, King Kong and Ann Darrow are both very . . . two-dimensional. Here, Kong is just a monstrous ape, and we see him only as a plain antagonist. At least 1976 and 2005 gave him a slightly better personality: he's a beast who finds himself someone that he has fully cherished for the first time. Ann Darrow does nothing but scream whenever she's with Kong, and since it was way back in 1933, she's really a typical damsel in distress, and she finds nothing fascinating about Kong.<br /><br />So yes, I have mixed feelings for all three Kong films. I do like them all for very specific reasons, but I don't consider any of them as a favorite of mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>The Turner 1989 colorized edition of RKO's KING KONG (1933) is skillfully rendered. One thing that's more apparent than ever with this new version is the beauty of Fay Wray, all natural save for a blonde Max Factor wig.<br /><br />Color schemes for the jungle sequences have an almost comic book quality-- misty orange skies prevail; they make an already frightening part of the story that much more ominous.<br /><br />Colorizing fails, as it often does, in crowd scenes-- here the many dozens of native villagers are broad-brushed in a fashion typical of early colorization. On the other hand, certain other aspects were quite naturalistic: torch fire had a proper tint, with the tops of flames appearing a bit deeper than the rest, also, wafting cigarette smoke doesn't interact with colors beyond-- the slight obscuration it causes appears most normal.<br /><br />Skin tones are good, background hues in man-made settings appropriate. The tints of the climactic skyscraper scene include well-defined cityscape and sky backdrops. On a 1 to 10 scale, I'd rate the enhancements a 7. The movie itself remains to my mind a solid 10.<br /><br />KONG TRIVIA--<br />The pilot and machine gunner that kill the giant ape are the film's director, Merian C. Cooper and producer, Ernest B. Schoedsack.<br /><br />The heavy-set native woman who sees Kong at her window is Etta McDaniel, Hattie's sister.<br /><br />The Great Wall was originally used in Cecil B. DeMille's silent epic, THE KING OF KINGS (1927).<br /><br />Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe has a cameo as a native dancer.<br /><br />Jean Harlow refused the lead in this picture.<br /><br />The 60th Anniversary edition of the b&w KING KONG includes a documentary.

The movie has not looked this good in my lifetime, which only reinforces how well "Kong" stands up as entertainment after over seventy years. The groundbreaking stop-motion effects work of Willis O'Brien are on full display, and while the acting style is decidedly pre-Method, the story enthralls, and the picture moves briskly along to that immortal climax atop the Empire State Building. An early sound masterpiece from directors Merian C. Cooper (who also helped originate the story) and Ernest B. Schoedsack.

A monster, a Beast by its size and its looks : it is nothing but a big chimpazee or gorilla. But that Beast is the ancestor of man and has feelings. The Beast is surviving as a god for some primitive tribe in the Pacific Ocean and he is transported into New York as some kind of grotesque exhibit in a show on Broadway. Civilization appears as trying to make a profit out of nature and its inhabitants. It turns sour because the Beast is in love with the main actress who was offered to him by the primitive tribe. We just need to get the Beast on top of the Empire State Building, its most famous achievement of all, for the film to be complete. But the Beast can only inspire curiosity when securely tied up and fear when at large. So the Beast, another archetype, has to be put to death without any more thinking about. Beauty and the Beast, the giant wild creature, its love for the beautiful blond woman, its final destruction and we have the pattern of many films that will come afterwards, even the pattern of some horror or burlesque films of today. As such this film is essential in the American cinema.<p>...</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>On October 9th, my dad and I went to go see King Kong at a theater in Anaheim Hills. It made me only appreciate more just how great of a movie this is, and that's considering I must have seen it at least half a million times before. <p>Of the dinosaur movies that came before and after King Kong, Kong is still the best one. The Lost World (1925) even today has impressive visual effects and is highly entertaining. It's only problems are a poorly written love story and the fact not everyone enjoys silent movies silent movies. The Godzilla films, while entertaining, had cheaper special effects and often times [the plots were not as good]. Jurassic Park (1993), which some consider the best dinosaur movie, has spectacular Special Effects and is very entertaining. But it is slow at times. King Kong, however, is both highly entertaining and, more importantly, is able to tell the film without a wasted scene or dialogue. I felt as if I was in the theater for only half an hour! If only all movies could do that. <p>But no film is made perfect by accident. This film had a top-notch technical cast made up of the best in the world at that time: Production designer Mario Larrnagia, Film Composer Max Steiner, Marcel Delgado, who built the dinosaur models and Willis O'Brien, who animated them. <p>Some have questioned as to why plant-eating herbivores like the Stegosaurus or the Brontosaurus would attack humans. Perhaps, the humans were trespassing into their territory and would you defend your property if someone tried to invade it? Also, how many humans living today have seen a live dinosaur in the wild? Then again, some might say this was done by the producers to provide entertainment and suspense. I can agree with that. But do not criticize King Kong for this. It's an adventure movie, not a documentary. <p>While the film is largely about Kong and the dinosaurs on Skull Island, the rest of the film is able to avoid being overshadowed. While I have seen movies that have better acting, this film's cast isn't too bad. At least they are able to conceive realistic characters. Even Jack Driscoll, the film's hero, gets afraid when he talks to Fay Wray. Some also find it annoying that Fay Wray only screams in the scenes where she is in Kong's presence. Well what would you do instead? Tell Kong in a polite, calm english voice to let you down? <p>I am surprised that this film is not yet on DVD. I am sure thought that one must be in the works.<br />I hope that when it does come out that it will be worth the wait and include a lot of extras, like the Citizen Kane DVD. <p>Overall, King Kong is a masterpiece that will be enjoyed for countless generations to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>Great HD transfer, tons of illuminating background material and the packaging is charming with foldout style booklet insert. This movie set the standard for high end blockbuster monster films and I still find it more satisfying than all the remakes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>At last, the first--and best--of the classic B/W monster movies has been transferred to DVD.  But not just transferred.  Warner's restoration is excellent, and with this new print we learn a number of interesting things:<br /><br />- Kong now has a friend named Biggs.<br />- When the airplanes confront Kong at the top of the Empire State Building, Kong shoots first.<br />- Jar-Jar has been added to Skull Island.<br />- The hunters' rifles have been replaced by walkie-talkies.<br />- A scene has been added that shows them bringing Kong into New York.  When asked for ID, Carl Denham says, "You don't need to see his identification.  This isn't the gorilla you're looking for."<br />- The last line has been changed from "Beauty killed the beast" to "Kong was your father!"<br /><br />Okay, okay, I'm kidding.  Fortunately, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had nothing to do with this release.  The present restoration really is excellent, though, for a 70+ year-old film.  They found this print in England, where, despite their own censorship board that required a "certificate of approval" to be placed at the start of every movie, they still didn't feel it necessary to cut out scenes that American censors snipped when the film was rereleased in 1938.  (There was no Hollywood censorship board when the film originally came out in 1933.)  The scenes cut were Kong peeling Fay Wray like a banana and sniffing her naughty bits, Kong stomping on natives, Kong biting natives' heads off, and Kong tossing a woman who was not Fay out her New York apartment window to her death.  All were deemed too violent, or, in the case of peeling Ms. Wray's clothes, they felt there was too much monkey business going on.<br /><br />But all the scenes are back in this new print (actually they had been restored years ago, but they're in better condition here than ever before).  There's also commentary by special effects whiz Ray Harryhausen (I didn't know he was still alive, to tell you the truth) and Ken Ralston, with additional comments here and there from producer Merion C. Cooper and, of course, Kong's squeeze, Fay Wray.  I would have liked more commentary from Wray and Cooper and less from Harryhausen and Ralston, especially since Ralston contributes nada that's worthwhile and I understand Wray has done more extensive commentaries for a laserdisc version that could have been used here.<br /><br />Disc two is mainly two documentary features, a look at the rough and tumble life of producer Merian C. Cooper and a lengthy look at the making of Kong.  The story of Cooper is probably the most eye-opening item on this DVD.  There was so much about the man I didn't know, and I have to confess I had no idea he did so much, both on and off the screen.  He's really one of the great Americans, yet you rarely hear his name mentioned today for anything other than King Kong.  Funny how one thing can eclipse everything else you do.  Cooper was such a war hero that he was actually allowed on the battleship Missouri for the signing of the treaty ending WWII hostilities.  And in WWI, he was shot down, captured by enemies, and nearly died--twice!  Cooper obviously modeled swashbuckler character Carl Denham on himself (even physically), just as love interest Jack Driscoll was modeled after the film's other producer, Ernest B. Schoedsack.<br /><br />The second documentary is largely the work of Peter Jackson, who is currently finishing up his remake of King Kong.  Jackson truly is the Kong fanatic.  He is not only remaking the film, he also reconstructed and reshot the famed "Lost Spider Pit Sequence" for this original film.  Using two still photos, numerous production sketches and a shot-by-shot script, Jackson and pals reenacted the scene on a small soundstage and then, using authentic 1930s technology, stop-motioned in the spiders and other creatures.  They then degraded the film with computers to match the quality of the 1933 print and spliced it in.  (After the premiere Cooper cut the spider scene out, feeling it slowed the picture and was too shocking in its own right.)  Jackson's work is shown in a roughly ten-minute excerpt on disc two.  (The actual movie on disc one is spider-free.)  While I appreciate the effort and the attention to detail, I'm somehow underwhelmed, though it's hard to say exactly why.  Despite all the frenetic action, Jackson doesn't direct with the rawness of the original--the spider scene was supposed to be the most horrifying moment in the film, yet the scenes where Kong munches on the natives pack more punch.  Also, the stop-motion animation of the sailors on the rock looks more like Ray Harryhausen than Willis O'Brien.  (I was slightly underwhelmed even when I first stumbled on this extra and played it without knowing it was a recreation--at first I thought they'd *really* found the spider pit sequence!)  Although Jackson dominates the second documentary, there are also sections on Max Steiner, who wrote the very effective score (its influence on William's Star Wars music is obvious), Murray Spivack, who recorded the impressive sound effects (Spivack himself voiced Kong's soft "grunts") and others who contributed to the film.  I wish they would have revealed how much the film actually cost and talked more about how the history of RKO and how the studio had everything riding on this picture.  Instead we get, in my opinion, a little too much screen time with today's Kongophiles talking about how this movie profoundly changed their lives.  (They get a little over the top after a while.  One also wants to buy Peter Jackson a comb, or maybe just take him to a barber.)<br /><br />There's also a second, separate track of the Jackson spider footage--redundant since it's also on an isolated track inside the second documentary.  Finally there's the original test footage for Creation, with commentary from Harryhausen again.  Creation is the project O'Brien was working on before Kong.  Cooper and Executive producer David O. Selznick liked Obie's work but were not impressed with the story behind Creation, so they scuttled the project, and O'Brien was brought in to do Kong instead.<br /><br />As for the movie itself...well, I'm not bothering with a review, because anyone who's reading this has already surely seen Kong a million times over the years.  But one has to ask, why all the interest in a creaky, 72-year-old film?  How is Kong relevant today, as anything more than ancient cinema history?  In some ways the film is a product of its time, with stilted dialogue, hokey setups, and some horrible stereotypes, against both Africans (or "natives" as they would say in the film) and women, who do little here except faint.  But in other ways the picture was light-years ahead of its time.  The thorough and seamless use of every special technique then possible (many of them invented for the film itself), the wall-to-wall music filled with leitmotifs for every character and exotic locale, the chases, the narrow escapes, the aerial battles at the end, the clean, three-act screenplay, the strong sense of atmosphere, the quick pacing, the superb production design, the advanced sound effects, the mythological or fairy-tale elements, the whole awesome spectacle of it all--does this remind you of some other ground-breaking film you probably grew up with?  One that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away?  Many of the techniques that have made Lucas and Spielberg incredibly rich were pioneered with Kong, and conceptually, if not necessarily in scene-for-scene execution, King Kong is as "modern" as any film today.  Amazingly so.<br /><br />Just has Kong came in two heights--about 15 feet on Skull Island and 25+ feet in New York City, King Kong the DVD is available in two sizes.  The standard release is the double-DVD set in the usual cardboard packaging.  The "Collector's Edition" contains the same two discs in said packaging, plus miniature reproductions of Kong movie posters (plus an offer to get a free full-sized one suitable for framing), and a reproduction of the original Grauman's Chinese Theater premiere booklet (interestingly, the booklet talks about the spider pit sequence that would subsequently be cut), all inside a larger, metal hinged case.  This larger case may not fit on all DVD shelves--but that's only appropriate for such a big movie about such a big ape, isn't it?</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>There was a poster popular during the 60s that showed the bound giant ape from the 1933 film on a stage with his arms outstretched under the caption: "King King died for your sins."<br /><br />Some saw it as blasphemy, or a mockery of the Christian religion.  While others of a more astute state of mind recognized the metaphor of the ferocious primitive instinct succumbing to the modern savagery of civilization with the bait of impossible sexuality and intimacy as a reward.<br /><br />Much has been written about the power of Kong's imagery and its impact when it was first released during the lingering great depression.<br /><br />Is there anyone who does not yet realize how we have sacrificed and exploited the finite resources of the primal world for our temporary gain?  What have we forever lost in the process?<br /><br />This week, Warner Home Video releases a newly remastered Blu-ray KING KONG (1933) with extensive bonus content, including a collectible Blu-ray Book written by renowned film historian Rudy Behlmer; a feature length documentary on Kong creator Merian C. Cooper, directed by acclaimed filmmakers Kevin Brownlow and Christopher Bird; commentary by Ray Harryhausen, Ken Ralston with vintage audio clips from Cooper and star Fay Wray; and a seven-part documentary that delves deeply into just about every aspect of the creation and production of this truly iconic film.<br /><br />With 32 pages of rare photographs and trivia, the captivating Blu-ray Book centers around the vision of director Cooper and his lager than life persona that brought the story of KING KONG to the screen.<br /><br />Film historian Behlmer interviewed Cooper and has written numerous books and contributed to many documentaries about Hollywood's Golden Age.<br /><br />This very special Blu-ray release is a newly remastered presentation of the 1933 premiere print in its entirety.  It includes controversial scenes that were cut from later re-releases.  Max Steiner's rousing score still stirs the blood.<br /><br />KING KONG was a milestone in movie making with pioneering special effects that incorporated miniaturization, stop-motion photography, rear screen inserts with miniatures and real sets.  The movie works on many levels beyond the obvious amalgam of adventure, monster, romance and horror.<br /><br />The film was way ahead of its time and defied the technological limitations of the 1930s.  Special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien was incredibly imaginative and effective -- even in today's era of photorealistic CGI effects.<br /><br />Although Peter Jackson's superb remake touches all the deeper emotional levels of Cooper's original story and is indeed a loving tribute, there remains something powerful and profound about this amazing piece of art that resonates with us today.<br /><br />See again this magnificent, strikingly original film directed and produced by Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack with stars Robert Armstrong, Bruce Cabot and Fay Wray whose indelible performance as distressed Ann Darrow forever locked Wray into the upper echelons of pop culture as the original "scream queen" and a role model of a resilient, independent woman for generations to come.<br /><br />Not long ago, someone sent me a piece of digitally Photoshopped art that shows the incoming terrorist jets approaching the World Trade Center and a still shackled Kong perched atop the twin towers taking down the planes before they can do their damage.  The caption: "Where was Kong when we needed him?"  Indeed.<br /><br />Merian Caldwell Cooper was a tough, adventurous guy.  He was the real deal.  He made several documentaries in wild, remote areas with his filmmaking partner Ernst B. Schoedsack.  But he invested everything he had in his planned production of a fictional depiction of an expedition that finds a great ape surviving from another age on an unmapped island.  When Cooper wrote his treatment for the movie, he said he had the ending before anything else.  "It was beauty killed the beast," he said.

Anyone born in the last twenty years probably thinks Star Wars, Blade Runner, or some other SciFi is the best of the Century. I myself must vote for King Kong. My reasons are simple. I have probably seen about every SciFi movie made in the last seventy plus years, and none were so well done for their time as King Kong. This movie influenced many people in the industry to strive for their best in the genre.<br /><br />Ray Harryhausen who was the best stop motion animator was greatly influenced by Willis O'Brien's work in this movie. Ask directors like Peter Jackson, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg and they will tell you it had a profound impact on them. Everything seemed to come together in this 1933 movie. The acting although a little corny has a nice appeal. The music is a nice touch of glitz in the city and foreboding danger in the jungle. It's the adventure the movie takes us on that we love most. The sets were done masterfully and the big ape himself was remarkable. The creatures truly frightened people many years after it's original release in the theater.<br /><br />This set includes many extras like a theater guide, poster, documentary, et cetera. I am very pleased with the care Warner took in the reproduction of King Kong. The picture and sound quality are excellent. I have complained for many years that this movie should have been put on DVD. I am glad to see it is finally released. The last remake of King Kong was not very successful, it will be interesting to see if the Peter Jackson remake becomes a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>King Kong is a iconic film that jumped started its genre. There may have been monster movies before Kong, but none with the long term impact of this film.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story. An adventurous promoter gets wind of something fantastic on a mysterious lost island, and sets out to turn a profit from it. They find a native village with a huge wall to protect them against ... something. When Kong, a giant gorilla, takes off with the beautiful blond, the ship's crew sets out to rescue her, finding more dangers and surprises on the island than just Kong.<br /><br />Unlike the remakes, the attraction between Kong and Ann Darrow in the original was all one way. Kong was seen as a monster to be exploited and ultimately feared and defeated. Still, this springboard for animator Ray Harryhausen provided the most realistic monster action seen on screen at the time, and Kong's battles with the other giant denizens of Skull Island were terrifying to behold.<br /><br />Sadly, with the proliferation of horror movies in color, its rare to see a screening of Kong on TV or cable anymore. As a kid I was able to watch it often. But even though more and more channels have cropped up, there is less broadcasting of classic old black and white films like this one. If you don't find one on TCM, you just about won't see a B&W film anymore. And now the local stations don't bother to show syndicated movies at all anymore. Infomercials and mindless talk shows, sadly, have filled those time slots. Therefore a fan of the original Kong wanting to revisit this film, or pass it along to kids or grand kids, just about has to get the DVD now to have a chance to view it. Luckily, the DVDs can be had at bargain prices.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of the Peter Jackson remake. Although it has a lot of critics, I believe that Jackson kept faithful to Merrian Cooper's original ideas, even though he did buy into the 70s idea of having some of the humans begin to care for Kong.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Anyone seeking to dismiss the original production of KING KONG as hopelessly flawed need look no further than the beast's fur, which appears in constant motion from being touched by the animator's hand for every frame.

Movie maker Robert Armstrong hires Fay Wray to be his star. They sail to Skull Island in Indonesia where evolution has gone awry. Dinosaurs roam, and a gigantic ape rules. Natives have built a wall to contain King Kong. They capture Wray and offer her as a sacrifice. Armstrong and his crew rescue her and transport Kong to Manhattan's Great White Way as a headliner. He breaks loose and terrorizes yet another island. He climbs the Empire State Building with Wray and is riddled with bullets from planes. He falls to his death. King Kong is a film which touches modern consciousness. It shows man clashing with the nature of which he is a part. There are interracial overtones. Armstrong declares, "It was beauty killed the beast."

Schoedsack, 1933)<br /><br />When I was a kid, I obsessed over monster movies. (Well, didn't we all?) I was eight when the 1976 remake of King Kong came out, and I saw it innumerable times on the Saturday afternoon creature feature over the years. But somehow, despite seeing clips from it thousands of times and having seen enough stills of it in monster-movies books and magazines when I was just a little squid, I somehow managed to never see the original version entire. I remedied that error last week. King Kong is one of those movies that constantly makes thousand-best lists (of all those I've compiled, only Jonathan Rosenbaum's leaves it off), but while I was watching it, I had to wonder: did it make the lists because of what it was in 1933, or because it holds up well today? Ideally, a truly classic film should be a mix of both (Murnau's Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens is a perfect example; at the time, it was revolutionary, with Murnau inventing new ways to film tracking shots and the like, while it still packs a creepy punch almost a century later just because it's a damned good movie); while there's no doubt that King Kong was revolutionary for its time, and did a great deal to advance the wonderful world of movie special effects, it was made at a time when silent film was still a credible option, and the expressionism inherent in silent film hadn't quite cleared off yet. And when I look at it like that, I realize just how modern it was, for its time; so many of the players in this movie give perfectly creditable performances. But the one who seems like a holdover from the silent film days where her acting is concerned is incapable of being ignored-- the movie's star, Fay Wray. Now, I grant you, she's supposed to be playing someone who's acting in a silent film, so had she kept the overacting for when she was in front of Robert Armstrong's cameras, well, that would have been all well and good. But even while everyone around her is acting in a more modern fashion, Wray is all about the overacting. It tends to get annoying.<br /><br />That said, the movie is exceptionally well-made (especially given Cooper and Schoedsack's previous collaboration, the somewhat anemic The Most Dangerous Game, made on a basement budget using the sets and actors, for the most part, the two were using for King Kong); the script is well-plotted and well-paced, much of the acting is at or above par for the time (Wray has already been noted; Victor Wong, who portrays Charlie the cook, plays his role well, but is so hopelessly stereotyped we never get to see what he's really made of), and of course the special effects were marvelous for the time. It is certainly still a watchable movie, and an enjoyable one. And maybe that's enough. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>The folks at Warner Bros.

You turn and find a young woman rubbing her chin.<br /><br />It's Ann Darrow.  She's that woman that Carl Denham brought aboard last night.  She is to star in his new picture.  The trouble is, women aboard a ship are a nuisance, but then Denham is paying for this trip.

Chilling, foreboding moment...<br /><br />The journey to Skull Island on the ship really gets you worked up for the entry onto the island itself and the encounter with the Natives, the various monsters behind the great gate (used in the burning of Atlanta in GWTW) and finally, Kong himself.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong delivers the movie's sole humorous line when the Native Chief is taken with Fay Wray and wants to trade livestock for her, Armstrong says "Yes, I guess blondes are kinda scarce around here."<br /><br />Once they get past the gate and into the jungle, things take off in a hurry. The trip by boat to another part of the island has one of the (still, to this day) scariest moments I have ever seen in any movie of the genre; a water monster that is truly terrifying. When I was a child, this monster really scared me witless.<br /><br />Eventually Fay Wray, what's left of the crew and Kong are delivered safely back to New York and it is at that point my fear of Kong changed to one of pity. The poor guy, taken out of his home, to a foreign environment, treated like a sideshow freak and placed in iron restraints, it was really awful to see. When, at the end, he is on the top of the Empire State Building, fighting off the airplanes, and loses the battle, I cried.<br /><br />And Armstrong's last line, the perfect summation of Kong's trials: "It wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast."<br /><br />GREAT movie, and fascinating to note Fay Wray only died last year! Born in 1907 and starred in one of the most famous films of all time...amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>An original thought:  Carl Denham(Robert Armstrong), shameless huckster that he is who risks the lives of the unwitting for his own personal glory, should have took the bullets instead of Kong.  Instead, he gets to mouth empty platitudes about beauty killing the beast over poor exploited Kong's dead body.  The cops should have slapped the cuffs on him for putting the general public in harm's way.  Now that I've got that off my chest I can extoll the virtues of "King Kong".  This film is not only a technological marvel but an exciting edge of your seat adventure film.  This is a slam dunk with the convergence of great storytelling and excellent technical craftmanship adding up to a timeless masterpiece.  The creatures designed for this film by Willis O'Brien are so expressive and lifelike that they have more character than the human actors.  I'm hoping that Peter Jackson's upcoming remake has a fraction of the original's inventiveness.</p></br><a href="../users/A38ZTUNQJVGP6S.html">A38ZTUNQJVGP6S</a><br/><p>King Kong is one hour and forty-five minutes long and was released in theaters on March 2, 1933. The movie begins on ship S.S. Venture and Carl Denham, a Producer\Director of jungle movies, is about to set sail to make his next big picture. Carl needs a female in his picture because the public demands it, but has no luck with any of the acting agents in town. Carl decides to look for one himself ever if he has to marry her. Carl finds Ann Darrow and convinces her to star in his movie. The crew set sail for Skull Island and once there they find a village of native people in the middle of a ceremony where they are about to sacrifice a female to their god Kong. The tribal chief spots Ann and offers Captain Englehorn six of his island women for Ann. He turns down the offer and the crew heads back to the ship. Later that evening Ann is kidnapped by the natives and is sacrificed to Kong. Kong takes Ann to the other side of the island and along the way battles with a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a giant lizard and a giant pre-historic bird. About thirteen men chase after Ann and King Kong and eleven of them meet a horrible death and only Carl Denham and Jack Driscoll survive. Jack is able to rescue Ann and bring her back to the village, but Kong is close behind. The remaining crew captures King Kong and brings the ape back to New York and is billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World.<br /><br />It is while the press is taking pictures of Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll that Kong thinks they are shooting at them. King breaks free of his chains and is able to find Ann and reclaim his true love. King Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State building where he would meet his untimely death. Kong is shot down by the planes and Carl Denham says those famous words: It was beauty that killed the beast.<br /><br /> There are a couple of things that I hated about the DVD version. First was the four minute overture that is not in the original movie; I am a giant fan of if it is not broke then don't fix it. Second is the commentary that is included in the DVD version. I really learned nothing new in the movie while the VHS version has a twenty-five minute segment on the making of King Kong. So buy the VHS version and copy it on a DVD disc and don't waste your money on the DVD version. The five stars goes for the movie King Kong and not the DVD.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Play<br />Scene Selections<br />Special Features<br />1.

In the mid-1920s Willis O'Brien became the first great master of the form, and in 1925 THE LOST WORLD became the first feature-length film to display it.  The film was a sensation, but the stop-motion process was  laborious and extremely expensive.  The early 1930s found O'Brien at RKO, where he worked on a stop-motion film tentatively titled CREATION.  As the Great Depression deepened, however, studio executives became increasingly wary of the cost involved and ultimately canceled the project.<br /><br />This would have likely been the end of O'Brien's career--but for a quirk of fate.  Production partners Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, famous for such exotic films as GRASS, CHANG, and THE FOUR FEATHERS, had arrived at the studio, and Cooper had a fantasy project: a movie about a gorillas.  When Cooper saw O'Brien's footage for the scuttled CREATION, he had a brainstorm that would become one of the most celebrated films of the decade: KING KONG.<br /><br />Much of KING KONG's fascination arises from O'Brien's stop-motion animation process.  At the time, it was the only way in which a film such as KING KONG could be realized, and the frame-by-frame animation process is "hand made" in a classic sense; adding to this fascination are the models themselves, beautifully rendered, and the miniature sets they inhabited.  But KING KONG would go quiet a bit further than stop-motion; it was made with considerable technical creativity, a film of rising technology that utilized everything from rear-projection to in-camera processes to laboratory techniques.  It captures a sort of critical mass in state of the art of its era.<br /><br />1933 audiences reacted to the film with amazement--and much may be said for contemporary audiences, albeit for considerably different reasons.  Where 1933 audiences found the film frightening real, modern viewers are stunned by the meticulous detail of its pre-digital accomplishment.  But if KING KONG were only a window on past cinematic technology, it would not be as widely embraced today as it is.<br /><br />The film has considerable merit in its directness, its pace, its score, its cast, its script, and the way in which the overall setting for O'Brien's stop-motion animation operates.  It has tremendous charm, a strangely innocent quality, and it deals in archetypes that boil in our culture as powerfully today as they did more than seventy years ago.  But most particularly, O'Brien and his artists and technicians succeed in endowing Kong with personality, and even today we relate to Kong in an emotional way.<br /><br />The recent double disk "collector's tin" package as a great deal going for it.  KING KONG is one of the most frequently censored films in Hollywood history, with bits removed in virtually every re-release.  With the exception of the "Spider Pit" sequence, which is likely forever lost, these cuts have been restored, and the quality of the restored cuts is as fine as the quality of the picture as a whole, something not always the case in previous video tape releases.  As for the visual quality of the release, it is quite fine indeed, easily the best I have seen.  Some complain that the sound has not been bumped into stereo, but I have no complaints on this point; KING KONG was filmed before the advent of stereo recording, and we hear it here very much as audiences heard it in 1933.<br /><br />The "collectors tin" is quite nice and the various paper items are enjoyable, but the bonus DVD material is of mixed quality.  Two documentaries are available, and both "I'm King Kong!: The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper" and "RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World" are quite good.  I found the latter particularly interesting inasmuch as it demonstrates how difficult modern film makers found it to reproduce the stop-motion animation process used in the 1933 film.  Peter Jackson, director of the 2005 remake, also spearheads a recreation of the lost "Spider Pit" sequence to extremely interesting effect, and stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen offers commentary on the surviving and very interesting snip of the aborted CREATION.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the audio commentary is chiefly remarkable for being utterly dismal.  Archival comments by Merian C. Cooper are interesting, but Ken Ralston clearly has only very superficial knowledge of the film and effectively leads Ray Harryhausen away from making any interesting remarks of his own.  As for archival comments by Fay Wray, you'll have to pay very close attention to catch them; they are so short and so insignificant that it seems likely the producers of this package included them only in order to put her name in the commentary line-up.<br /><br />This seems a tremendous pity, for Wray gave numerous interviews over the years concerning KING KONG; it is an opportunity missed.  But most shocking of all, once again Willis O'Brien gets the short end of the stick.  He figures prominently in the two documentaries, but he is never given the same level of interest as Cooper.  It is an opportunity lost.  But even with such drawbacks to the overall package, KING KONG remains KING KONG.  One can only hope there will be a more comprehensive package in the future.  Until then, we will have to make do--and with such a beautiful print of the film itself, "making do" is a pleasure.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is a good blu ray.  NO doubt about it. They did a fine job with the print here as far as cleaning it up. But it is a 80 year old movie so you can't expect it to look like a newer flick. Still the extras are good on this one ,and one of the cinemas alltime greats deserved this treatment. It's not perfect but at least it's not a scratched up mess! Like lets say 'galaxina' or a dirty print like 'kelly's heroes'. However I would say that if  you love old movies like this one and I bet even some people that are young today still love this old movie with it's stop motion effects too, then you will be pleased with this blu ray. It's as good as we can expect at this date with a film this old. Picture wise I was impressed mostly but then I have seen prints from movies from the 90's that looked all beat up on blu ray. This is more classy; but don't expect the clarity in all scenes that a modern movie would have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>When a boy in the 50's there were only 3 stations in N.Y.  There was a show called 'The Movie of the Week' and they would play the same movie 4 or 5 times a day, every day, for the week.  If it were King Kong, I watched it every single time that I was not in school or didn't have to be somewhere.  King Kong caught everyone's imagination and I have seen it 100's of times, never being bored.<br /><br />So how is the quality of this BluRay transfer.  Remember that this movie was released in 1933 so the technology was no where near what it is today.  My mother told me that her father took her to see the opening premier at Radio City Music Hall.  It's an old film.  However, with the discovery of an uncensored archive of the movie in the UK, the transfer quality to Blu Ray is about the best you can expect it to be.  There are some scenes early in the movie and a few with much daylight in them that do have plenty of grain but, at least for this movie, the grain brings you back to those old times and you never really notice it.  The jungle and stop motion scenes are beautiful to watch without artifacting and aliasing and without the film damage of dust and tears that we normally would come to expect.  The blacks are deep and unmolested.  In fact, in some areas they look a touch crushed.  Never the less, this is the best quality version of King Kong I have ever seen.  All censored scenes have been restored to the film as well.<br /><br />The audio is mono but the score fills the room and is clear and easy to understand so no complaints here that we do not have a 5.1 channel mix.  Heck, back in 33 the word stereo had not been invented yet.<br /><br />This brings me to my only complaint about the DVD itself.  I found that switching to sections of the menu was quite difficult.  When I first put it in the player the movie started with the subtitles running.  I went back to the menu but could not direct the highlighter to 'none' and had to  pop the disc out and put it back in again to go to the default.  This occurred a few times.  Same thing with the special extras, I found it very difficult to actually use the remote arrows to go to a specific extra.  I found that the easiest thing to do was just hit enter, and the extras played in order.<br /><br />The documentaries of the film makers and their inspirations were very interesting and informative and Peter Jackson's recreation( and how he went about it) of the lost spider sequence was just brilliant and, for me, well received.  He did the original film proud.<br /><br />For anyone even remotely considering the purchase of this Blu Ray DVD, go ahead, as a King Kong fan, you will be glad you did.<br />Hope you found this review useful, and, if so, please click on the 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right track.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>When film lovers discuss the merits of KING KONG, they often focus on the 'big' scenes, Kong on the Empire State Building, Kong bursting out of his shackles on stage in New York, Kong battling a series of prehistoric beasts on Skull Island.  KING KONG surely is deservedly known for these, but the movie's enduring power to enthrall each new generation of viewer is based on the movie's more subtle, yet equally mesmerizing lesser scenes, not all of which involve him.  What is astounding to a generation of contemporary audiences jaded by computer enhanced special effects is the way the movie has held up over the decades.  The stop-motion animation of Willis O'Brien shows a Kong as seamless as any computer could project today, and certainly as far superior to the 1976 King that groped Jessica Lange.  One of the reasons that this more recent Kong failed to resonate with modern audiences is that the somber, brooding mood of the original was reflected in the gauzy, hazy photography that showed the jungle of Skull Island to be every bit the Jurassic danger that Spielberg envisioned for his theme park. Repeated viewings of the sailors that slug their way through the jungle to find Ann Darrow emphasize the lurking monsters behind every tree and hill.  Directors Schoesdsack and Cooper (both of whom had bit parts as the pilot and machine gunner who shot Kong off the Empire State Building) would introduce each succeeding reptilian threat from a distance, almost lulling the sailors and the audience into a false security that the beast was not a threat.  But then, they would focus the camera on a twitch of the beast's head.  One could see and hear the beast sniff the air as a preparation to attack.  When it did attack, the assault came on like a runaway train.  Sometimes the guns of the sailors killed or drove it away, and sometimes they didn't.  It is this constant sense of menace that permeates Skull Island that serves as a prelude to meeting the King himself.  The sailors and natives saw Kong first, of course, when he grabbed Ann Darrow, but they had to experience the power of those outsized simian thews as Kong rolled them off the log into an unknown, dank horror below.  As many scenes of subtle, psychological power as there are on Skull Island there are an equal number in New York, a city which contains more deadly dragonflies than his home stomping grounds.  As one sees Kong rage over his abducted girlfriend both on Skull Island and in New York, one can see that Kong is not much more different from any guy who sees another dude swipe her.  His reaction each time is predictably violent.  As his violence increases, so does his ability to think rationally decrease.  Kong is a beast, sure, but he is a thinking, rational one who in the parlance of lawyers seeking to explain the murderous behavior of their clients, has 'lost it' since he was pushed beyond the limits of simian endurance.  But what elevates Kong beyond his more human killer counterparts is his inner sense of inherent nobility that comes out at crucial moments.  There is no doubt that he is a self-sacrificing creature who would unhesitatingly lay down his life for his mate.  He proves that on Skull Island and on the Empire State Building.  When Kong lays Ann down to face the swirling attack planes, he meets them as one king to another.  He beats his chest, roaring out his defiance, knowing full well that the power that overwhelmed the prehistoric beasts on Skull Island would fail him here.  For that brief moment, Kong transcends a beast out of his element.  The audience applauds a creature who in years to come would morph into John Wayne, Rocky, and every other hero worshipped by audiences in the theater with every bit of the fervor worshipped by the natives behind their huge wooden gate.  Kong was the king in every sense of the word in both his island in the Pacific and the island off the Atlantic.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>One of the greatest movies of all time.  Even after Peter Jackson created his interpretation of Kong, King Kong (1933) still lives on.  The movie was first remade in 1976 but the first still remains the best.

Definitely one to pick up.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>KING KONG! Just taste that name. It s t i l l  is a household name. I`m gonna be brief: 2 think that it is made 5 years after Hollywood was transformed 2 sound is amazing. The camera moves, the sound is good(as are the soundeffects), the music, the story and most of the actors are all good. The production values? Stunning. Compare it with CLASH OF THE TITANS from 1981 if u don`t believe me. Fay Wray i s a good screamer but not that much as an actress.  After numerous videotapes I now own it on DVD. Of course it is great but it DOESN`t include the "making of". Hmmm. Last friday I watched JURASSIC PARK III and went straight home and saw KONG. Well. Hello? In 1933 they at least had something called WRITERS and story developers. A job that may be overlooked by Hollywood these days. KING KONG? A forever treat though his first appearances is difficult to frighten of these days.<br /><br />On January 16 2006, I bought the color version of this film and I have to admit it. IT`S EVEN BETTER in color.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>No matter how much the special effects may have dated by now, there's no question they get you to believe in the story. When watching the MAKING OF documentary and realizing each minute of Kong represented some 1,200 micro movements, you can't but feel thankful.<br />There are, however, a handful of things that left me wondering after watching this DVD:<br />1) Denham refering to Ann Darrow as the "bravest girl you'll ever meet" when she spends the whole film screaming and passing out.<br />2) When one of the sailors climbs into a three with just the right height for him to become the easiest of lunches for a dinosaur.<br />3) When you notice Kong changes size all througout the film.<br />4) When you notice Kong miniature and real-size don't look alike at all.<br />5) When you notice the human characters, usually in a "small window" of the frame staring at Kong, are constantly looking up or down too much as the actors didn't know with precision where he'd be standing.<br />6) When you wonder why in heck the natives build a convenient large door in the wall for Kong to punch through.<br />Small quibbles all but still interesting to find.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>King Kong - The world's first blockbuster.  An epic for its time, 1933, and still memorable nearly 80 years later.  There's no doubt the movie is a classic, but the question is, how does this Blu Ray release fair to past releases and is it worth the upgrade?<br /><br />Well.. I'm torn.  The BD transfer IS good despite some who claim otherwise, you can tell this explicitly during intimate shots (Ex: not in the jungle) and especially during the opening credits, BUT for those seeking a really glossy high definition experience (example: the comparable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWONB2">Casablanca [Blu-ray</a>]) King Kong probably isn't your best bet.  If, however, you're looking to have the best possible release King Kong has ever seen, this is it, for better or worse.  Considering the film's age and that many scenes were inhibited with misty jungle fog and primitive special effects, I have the feeling that the slightly hazy look of the picture isn't going to go away no matter how advanced film restoration has come along. Let me assure you it's not That bad, though.  Some of the reviews are making it to sound like it's unwatchable or messy, and it's really not.  If you've seen the movie before you know it's old and shows its age, but I assure you the DVD release is by far less clear than this BD.  There may not be a jaw-dropping difference like we see all the time with HD releases, but it is significant.<br /><br />Overall, I think you know whether or not you should get this.  For film fanatics, history buffs, King Kong enthusiasts, this is an easy purchase.  Kong is never going to look any younger and for that it's hard to place a price tag. But for the fan with little more than passing interest, eh, you can live without.  Worth renting for sure, but $20+ bucks is a little steep, slice of history or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>King Kong is a classic that never gets old, this DVD is worth getting if you don't already have the more expensive version of the 1933 classic that was release on DVD a few months ago. The picture is clear but there are no extras on the film except for commentary.<br /><br />No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Compared to the new movie, this film seems to lack the emotion the newer version has, but it doesn't stop me from loving this movie. Overall a great DVD to buy at a cheap price if you don't already own this movie. Lack of any real extras, but still good</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>One of the greatest movie monsters has finally arrived on DVD. Master showman Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) leads an expedition to a remote tropical island and discovers a 30 foot tall gorilla that falls for his new female star Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). The expedition manages to bring the colossal beast back to New York City for exhibition but it escapes to terrorize the city. After 70 years, "King Kong" still remains as one of the most entertaining movies in cinema history. This classic film features a well paced story, rousing action sequences, a good music score and a great finish. Special effects technician Willis O'Brien was an important part in the development of "King Kong" and changed moviemaking with his ingenious stop motion animation. The scene of Kong facing the airplanes on top of the Empire State Building is a memorable Hollywood moment. Director Merian C. Cooper and producer Ernest B. Schoedsack have small cameos as the flight commander and gunner of the airplane that attacks Kong. The breakthrough hit inspired numerous filmmakers and effects technicians.<br /><br />If you were expecting a simple DVD for this landmark classic, then get ready to experience "King Kong" Special Edition. The classic film is presented in its original full screen format. The DVD contains a terrific black and white video transfer and a well balanced 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. This 2-Disc DVD features an audio commentary by cast members and effect artists Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston, an extended "The Making of Kong" documentary, several special effects featurettes, theatrical trailers and eye-catching interactive menus. Overall, "King Kong" scores a winning "A".</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>I loved "King Kong" when I was a young child.  Every time my father took me to the video store, I either rented "Star Wars" or "King Kong".  But it had been probably seven years since I'd seen it.  After watching Peter Jackson's new "King Kong", I really wanted to watch the original once more.  So when I received this collector's tin as a Christmas present, I wasted little time in watching the movie.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story: bigshot movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) recruits poor nobody Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to star in his latest picture.  Carl has a map that will lead him to an island that no white man has ever set foot on.  But rumor has it that some sort of beast rules the island.  It sounds like native superstition ... but as Carl, Ann, and their shipmates soon find out, it's much more.<br /><br />"King Kong" is one of the true cinema classics, and it doesn't take much to see why.  The cast is great.  Scream queen Fay Wray was a great choice for Ann Darrow, while Robert Armstrong really shows us what a cheapskate Carl Denham really is.  Of course, there's also Bruce Cabot as Jack Driscoll, the tough first mate who falls in love with Ann.<br /><br />Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack direct the film with a sense of wonder and intrigue.  (Look for the duo as fighter pilots towards the end of the film.)  The script, by James Ashmore Creelman and Schoedsack's wife, Ruth Rose, is still good, even by today's standards.  Creelman and Rose took a potentially fine idea and turned it into a grand screenplay.<br /><br />And then there's Max Steiner's terrific score.  It switches from mysterious, maybe a little eerie, to horrifying and suspenseful, and then to romantic and dramatic.<br /><br />But, without a doubt, the true highlight of the film is Willis O'Brien's legendary special effects.  O'Brien's stop-motion animation revolutionized fantasy moviemaking.  His effects are still spectacular to this day; one can only imagine how terrifiying and magnificent they must have seemed back in 1933.  Especially fine is the classic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus Rex, as well as the crew's escape from an agrivated Brontosaurus.<br /><br />It's taken many years for "Kong" to arrive on DVD, but at long last it has, and it was well worth the wait.  This 2-disc set is precisely what the film deserves.  The picture looks as fine as could be expected for a film that's over seventy years old.  There's a terrific assortment of special features, including the first audio commentary ever recorded for a film, featuring Fay Wray and Ray Harryhausen.  My favorite of the special features is the enticing documentary "RKO Production 601: The Making of 'Kong, The Eighth Wonder of the World'".  Another wonderful extra is a re-construction of the legendary lost spider pit sequence, by Peter Jackson (who directed the 2005 remake of the film).  The sequence almost seems like it was taken directly out of the original film, and it's as close to the original as it possibly could be.<br /><br />"King Kong" is a classic masterpiece that has lost little of its magic over the years.  Now, a new generation can re-discover this sensational picture on this great DVD set.  The collector's tin also includes a reproduction of the original souvenir booklet, a collection of mini-posters, and a mail-in form for a reproduction of the 1933 theatrical poster.  This set is needless to say essential for fans, and very highly recommended for anyone has yet to experience the eighth wonder of the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" they ask the musical question, "Whatever happened to Fay Wray?" Tonight we know the answer since the actress passed away at the age of 96 and of course every single notice of her death mentions the role that made her immortal as the beauty loved by the beast in the 1933 classic "King Kong." Wray had been noticed in a few films before that, such as Stroheim's "The Wedding March" (1928), "Thunderbolt" (1929), "Doctor X" (1932), and "The Vampire Bat" (1933). Then came her rendezvous with the biggest leading man in history and Fay Wray made her claim to the honor of being the greatest screamer in movie history.<br /><br />Fay Wray is remembered not just because she played opposite King Kong but also because as Ann Darrow she was both sexy and vulnerable. Plus she had the big ape's lung capacity beat six ways to Sunday. Granted, the special effects by Willis O'Brien are enough to make this a classic film, the cinematic forefather of "Jaws," "Jurassic Park" and other celluloid monster movies that involve something other than an actor in makeup. But every time you want to reduce "King Kong" to pure technical achievement, you hear Fay Wray screaming her head off.<br /><br />The story was pretty much a clich&eacute; the moment it was set down on paper. Movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) has heard the legend of Kong and hires a ship to find Skull Island. Ann Darrow is starving and destitute, but photogenic and he hires her to be the beauty part of the equation in the film he has planned. Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), the first mate of the tub they are traveling on takes an interest in the young girl's safety, and she responds with guarded affection. Then they get to the island and he discovers that he is indeed involved in a love triangle, but the third party is not Denham, but a giant ape.<br /><br />One thing you have to give directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack credit for in this film is that they give Kong a big build up and then they deliver. On the way to the island Denham was making a film test with Ann and had her scream. Then she sees Kong for the first time and takes it to a whole new level. At that point the film becomes a series of action sequences as Kong takes the girl into the jungle, Driscoll leads a rescue party after her only to have Kong follow them back to the native village (the look of terror on Wray's face as she runs for her life through the jungle is equally memorable), which Kong proceeds to destroy before being captured. Then there is the final act of the drama as King Kong, the 8th Wonder of the World is put on display in New York City, only to break free, once again capture Ann, and take her to top of the Empire State Building (whose lights will be dimmed tomorrow night in Wray's honor).<br /><br />I think the T-Rex attack sequence in "Jurassic Park" is one of the greatest in any monster movie ever made, and I have argued that in addition to the special effects and the masterful cutting of the scene, the sound of the T-Rex is an integral part of what makes the scene work so well. Tonight I am going to make the same argument for Kong's first appearance in "King Kong." After all, we are talking about mixing stop motion animation with a giant mechanical head, but such "primitive" special effects are forgiven because Fay Wray's screams convince you it is really happening. She was not remembered just because she was the girl in "King Kong" (quick, name the actresses who had the female lead roles in "Dracula" and "Frankenstein"). She was remembered because she was an integral part of the film's success (To save you the trouble of looking up the previous trivia point: Helen Chandler and Mae Clarke).<br /><br />You might have heard that Peter Jackson, as his next project after "The Lord of the Rings," is doing a remake of King Kong for 2005. The cast has Jack Black as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody as Jack Discoll, Andy Serkis as both King Kong and Lumpy the Cook (?), and Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow. Watts is a fine actress, but can she scream like Fay Wray? I don't think so. But then Jessica Lange was not exactly a great screamer and her career turned out okay.<br /><br />Final Notes: This is the "restored" version of the film, but it still does not include the legendary scene when four crewmen who are shaken off the log by Kong fall into a ravine where they are eaten alive by giant spiders. When first previewed the scene stopped the movie cold and Cooper pulled it from the film. The scenes that were cut in the late 1930s and not restored until the 1970s were (a) where Kong pulls Ann's clothes off; (b) the shots of the Apatosaurus (nee Brontosaurus) biting the sailors; (c) Kong eating natives when he breaks through the gate; (d) Kong stepping on a native; (e) Kong biting a New Yorker after escaping from the theater; and (f) Kong grabbing the wrong woman from the hotel and throwing her to her death. It would be nice if they could find the spider sequence or any of the other bits we know were cut by Cooper before the film was released, but it is probably never going to happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>With the recent re-make of this film, I hope more people take the opportunity to check this movie out, the original King Kong, if they've never seen it.<br /><br />This movie must have been astounding to the people watching it over 70 years ago. I doubt they'd ever seen anything like this, action-wise, and monster-wise. It is still fascinating today, even with the great advancements in special effects.<br /><br />Most action films from the classic years, from 1920 to the late 1960s had corny mostly unrealistic special effects but this film still holds up, extraordinarily so considering its age. The film also had a tremendous amount of action. People today are usually bored watching old black-and-white movies but they wouldn't be bored with this one. Once the "girl," Fay Wray gets captured by King Kong, the rest of the movie is one long action scene.....but not way overdone as the 2005 version was.<br /><br />Two re-makes and this old, old film still is the best King Kong. Amazing!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on "Million Dollar Movie". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as "Kong", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious "Kong".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious "Kong" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of "Kong". Notwithstanding the fact that "Kong" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls "King Kong" and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago.  It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>Let us all just forget, for a moment, all that we've come to know about mechanical sharks, blue screens and CGI, and go back in time to the year 1932, when KING KONG was being made.<br /><br />Talking pictures were only five years-old.  KING KONG was about to introduce hardcore action combined with snappy dialogue and a spectacular musical soundtrack by Max Steiner.  In 1925, the silent film, THE LOST WORLD, had given audiences one of its first glimpses into the world of stop-and-go motion in the world of dinosaurs.  In April of 1933, the world was blown away by a giant ape and his all-out assault on humanity and the great city of New York.  Try to imagine audiences sitting in Radio City Music Hall in complete awe, asking themselves, "How on earth did they do that???"<br /><br />Movie-making techniques shall continue to advance as long as the motion picture industry exists.  And lo, let us never forget it's most momentous and significant origin...with the eighth wonder of the world!<br /><br />Peter Jackson has said that after he saw KING KONG as a child, he knew he wanted to make movies.  Who can blame him?</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Ray Harryhausen never forgot the first time he saw the original "King Kong." "I haven't been the same since," the special effects wizard of "Jason and the Argonauts" and "Mysterious Island" says. "That shows how a film can change a whole life sometimes." Harryhausen figures he's watched the 1933 classic something like 175 times -- "You see something different in it every time you run it." For his 176th screening, DVD viewers are invited to listen in.<br /><br />On the DVD debut of "King Kong," Harryhausen and younger colleague Ken Ralston ("The Polar Express") spin a relaxed and often delightful commentary. At times they're experts dissecting the groundbreaking effects work; then they just seem like youngsters awed by the giant ape's sound and fury. The restored "King Kong" contains the 4 1/2 minutes that were censored as too risque or violent -- scenes such as the one in which Kong tears away some of Faye Wray's clothes. Or his size-98 foot doing the monster mash on an islander.<br /><br />The main nitrate print used for the restoration and transfer came from Britain, where "Kong" apparently roamed unmolested. The black-and-white images look sensational coming from a film that's almost 75 years old. The mono sound delivers the roars, screams and pounding drums without age-related distortion. The "Kong" DVD, with its generous suite of bonus features, completes a circle of sorts -- Criterion's laserdisc of 1985 was one of the first videos to include commentary and onscreen extras.<br /><br />The highlight, aside from the still potent 1933 film, is a chronicle of Peter Jackson's reconstruction of legendary lost "spider pit" sequence -- the missing link in the "Kong" tale. Unlike other fans, he was in the position to resurrect it -- which the director did as a side project, "purely for fun," as he started production on the new "Kong." The set's docu "RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World," is well worth the time investment.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>This is the best presentation, by far, that "King Kong" has received on home video. It's almost as good as seeing the film for the first time.<br /><br />Yes, some scenes have a lot of grain. SO WHAT. The beautiful details of the miniature sets and Dor&eacute;-inspired backgrounds are visible in a way they never quite were before. Technical inadequacies are also more-visible, most-notably unstable matte lines.<br /><br />The supplemental material is above-average, including two hours' worth of material on the film's gestation and production. All the work Obie did for "Creation" is included, in beautiful HD transfers.<br /><br />But the very best supplement is the lost spider-pit sequence. I watched it before anything else, thinking "They've finally found it!" But they hadn't. Peter Jackson studied the highly detailed script and came up with a plausible story board. The monsters were created, the sequence animated, and then "downgraded" to look like a 1933 film. The illusion is perfect. And it's infinitely better than Jackson's excessive and overwrought take on the scene for his unnecessary and pointless remake.<br /><br />My only gripe is that "Son of Kong", a charming and unassuming sequel, is not included. But the disk is so stuffed with material there probably wasn't enough room.<br /><br />Recommended without hesitation. A necessary addition to any film-lover's Blu-ray library.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>That King Kong is an undisputable classic that not only unshered in a whole new era of special effects and has influenced EVERYONE since (ask George Lucas and Jim Cameron, for two), but is also timeless as a classic in and of itself is a given for anyone who knows anything about movies, so why even get into that?<br /><br />What makes this DVD a complete gem is that the presentation is absolutely flawless. The film itself is complete and razor-sharp; It looks as if would had they found a pristine never-shown print somewhere.<br /><br />The extras are simply tremendous, and completely fascinating without ever being idol worship or techno-boring.

Still suspenseful, captivating, and action packed. You gotta love the scream from Ann, too!<br /><br /> So if you have not seen it, see it now! And see the new remake by Peter Jackson, coming next week.<br /><br />SOME FUN FACTS ABOUT KK: The special effects are pretty unique. Kong is a scale model that's only 18 inches. They used stop motion. The movement of the monsters are pretty funky and fun to watch. Kong's roar is a lion's and tiger's roar combined and played backwards. Grossed $90,000 its opening weekend - the biggest opening ever at the time. Was voted the 47th Greatest Film of all time by Entertainment Weekly.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>First off, this is a really fine set. The film looks better than I expected and the additional materials are fairly fascinating.  This is a good example of a movie being well-served by DVD.<br /><br />Also very cool is the documentary about the lost spider pit sequence and how Peter Jackson recreated it.  I actually wasn't that impressed with the recreation -- it's fine, and I'm sure they had fun, but it's mostly just an exercise.  Still, the documentary *about* the spider pit sequence, and how Jackson and Frank Darabont and Rick Baker et al put it together is interesting enough almost to stand alone on its own.<br /><br />About THE MOVIE: This is a film I'd always *thought* I'd seen.  In fact, I'd only seen bits and pieces of the original but most of what I knew about "Kong" came from seeing the remake as a kid.<br /><br />I've now seen it, though, and it's a pretty amazing little creation.  Exciting, amusing, passionate, occasionally vicious and always a little mysterious.  I watched it primarily because I'm very psyched for the '05 remake, but was completely impressed and even if the new version stinks (which I kind of doubt) it's done me a service by leading me to this strange little gem.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>Interpretations--psychological, anthropological, social, evolutionary, racial--abound about 1933's KING KONG. &quot;King Kong is about our inner animal of rage&quot;, &quot;King Kong is a critique of man in modern urban times&quot;, &quot;King Kong is about technology killing our true nature...&quot; Ad infinitum, ad nauseum.<p>PUH-LEASE! KING KONG is simply a great story, perfectly directed, with the best animation techniques for its time. While the acting (by humans) is admittedly the weakest link in this film, it has so much else going for it, like suspense, horror, pathos, love, and tragedy. King Kong, the animal, is complex and there are different emotions we experience about him. We don't like him when he gobbles up people or smashes the 2nd Avenue el (an incredible scene!). We admire him for trying to save Fay Wray from the flashbulbs. And we feel incredibly sad when he's killed. Why? I think it's because we see him as a human, at least of having human qualities. But to extend that to some deeper, intellectual level is pointless. It's just an amazing film.<p>Last comment: The film also has some humor. As a New Yorker, I love the dialogue between the two women at the theater, waiting to see King Kong.<p>Girl one: &quot;Hey, what's this show about, anyway?&quot;<br />Girl two: &quot;I don't know. Some big gorilla.&quot;<br />Girl one: (after a clod accidentally steps on her toe): &quot;Aw. Ain't we got enough of them in New Yawk?&quot;<p>I can't get enough of this classic film.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>So Fay Wray confides into the tuxedo lapel of Bruce Cabot, the brave first mate who saved her from the clutches of Kong. They stand in the wings of a theatre, looking at the giant ape now held by chrome steel chains on stage, but little do they know that Kong is far from vanquished, that his fury is only moments from being unleashed on New York City itself. &quot;King Kong&quot; really is one of my favorite movies of all time. Where else can you find gritty Depression era sentiments mixed up with a wild action horror film? Other horror movies from the 30s--&quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, even &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the most part--concern elegant drawing room aristocrats in full evening costume, but &quot;King Kong&quot; is about working class folks trying to make a living, whether it's cranking out a jungle movie like Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) or running a ship like Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). And poor Ann Darrow, who can't even find work back in NY, becomes a figure of obsession for the dangerous natives of Skull Island.  If you love movies like &quot;42 Street&quot; and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, I assure you,  you would find the same kind of dialogue in &quot;King Kong&quot;. Every time I watch it, I focus on some other detail, like the mutterings of the ship's crew as they make their way through the marshes trying to track down Kong, who has absconded with Fay Wray in his fist. Or the wonderful histrionics of Fay as she reacts to Kong's battle with a Tyrannosaurus Rex--and remember, she's really seeing nothing, all the figures are really clay models added later! Or the little faces at the skyscraper windows who watch as Kong destroys an elevated train near Herald Square. Here is one movie I genuinely never tire of watching. I can't imagine that there's somebody who has never seen &quot;King Kong&quot;, but if that's so, don't deny yourself the pleasure any longer!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I guaranty you that when `King Kong' was released way back in 1933 that no one, and I mean NO ONE, even entertained the notion that it would turn into a classic to redefine classics.  Sure, they probably thought it would rake in the big money and that the special effects (which are quite unbelievable even today) would be the start of something wonderful, but to become a cinematic staple; I highly doubt that idea was even considered.  But, regardless of their initial thoughts, `King Kong' has become as legendary as the title character, and for good reason.<br /><br />Now, I will let you know this right off the bat; I have seen both this film and Peter Jackson's 2005 remake and I firmly believe that Jackson's film is superior.  Know that, because, while I am going to praise this '33 classic I am also going to try and point out the reasons why Jackson's is the better film.<br /><br />Please, devoted fans, don't click the `unhelpful' button just yet.<br /><br />Most everyone knows the premise of `King Kong', but here is a quick rundown.  Carl Denham is a movie director who wants to give the public something they've never seen, and so he gets a large crew to travel to a distant island no white man has ever seen (well, except the one that gave him the map) to film a moving picture with the mythical beast known as Kong.  When they arrive his leading starlet, Ann Darrow, is taken hostage by the natives and offered to Kong, who falls in love with her.<br /><br />What this '33 version does extremely well is take the standard `movie monster' formula and perfect it, with state of the art effects that are still mind blowing today.  Don't get me wrong, there is no way that these effects can technically hold a candle to those of today, but they are still impressive.  I couldn't believe that these came out of 1933, they are truly remarkable.  Most of the older films suffered from the lack of reality in their special effects, but nothing is taken away from this film at all.  The action sequences are all superb, and there are a lot of them; each one as exciting as the last and completely engrossing.  The acting is also quite good for a film of this nature.  One has to remember that you have to understand the genre before you can critique a film.  Monster movies are made much differently than dramas or comedies or epics and so you have to judge accordingly.  For a monster film, the acting is spot on.  Fay Wray is totally believable as the wide eyed damsel in distress and Robert Armstrong is fabulous as the greedy in-over-his-head director; and macho man Bruce Cabot makes good use of his character to create a hunky (and even realistic) hero.<br /><br />So, for a monster film this one is top, top notch.<br /><br />But, and here is that dreaded `but', this is just that; a monster film.  Now, I admit to having seen Jackson's film first (how did THAT happen?) and so I was expecting something else from this version, but regardless of what I was expecting or what I saw first I feel my opinion would still be the same.  What is so glorious about Jackson's reinterpretation is that he takes the genre and adds so much warmth and depth.  Devoted fans of the original have attacked the '05 film rabidly, but I feel that is unfair.<br /><br />IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENJOY BOTH FILMS PEOPLE!<br /><br />Yes, Jackson's film is three hours long but what he does with those three hours is phenomenal.  I don't understand the complaints about the beginning, for Jackson actually establishes these characters as real people and makes us like or dislike them depending on their depictions.  We get to know who they are, which helps us to follow their storylines later in the film; and his reinterpretations of Skull Island are impeccable (those graphics are TO DIE FOR), and the pacing is flawless, that final Empire State Building scene is flawless (and one of the best scenes in cinema this decade) and the fact that he actually gets a deep rooted emotional response from the audience based on the love blossoming from a woman and an oversized monkey is just remarkable.<br /><br />So, I don't want to review Jackson's film (I'll do that later) but I just wanted to point out that they are two separate films.  In the 30's you just didn't make relatable monster films.  The point for `King Kong' was not to reach out emotions but to excite and thrill us, and it did just that, but as Jackson (and many other modern filmmakers) has proven, today you don't have to make a conventional anything anymore.  It is possible to blur the lines between genres and offer us something that excites all of our senses, giving us something funny, scary, moving and all around engaging without slacking in your delivery.<br /><br />Yes, the original `King Kong' is a classic, and deservedly so; but Jackson's `Kong' is a much more complete `film' in every sense of the word.<br /><br />And `YAY ME' on review #1,000!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>Saturday afternoons were made for great adventure yarns, and serials dating all the way back to the silent era played upon our love of a rousing good jungle story, filled with danger and the thrill of discovery, with just enough romance thrown in to suggest love sprung from such exciting endeavors. RKO would make the most supreme adventure of all time and in 1933 change the expectations of moviegoers forevermore once the lights dimmed and their logo adorned screens across America. A new bar for adventure was set, and the film which raised it was King Kong. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Shoedsack helmed this fabulous RKO film from an idea by Cooper and Edgar Wallace.<br /><br />King Kong was much more than a girl screaming as a huge ape held her in his palm, just as Fay Wray was much more than a "B" icon with one great sound film to her credit. She had graced many silent productions, including Coast Patrol, Street of Sin, The Wedding March, and Paramount's last silent, The Four Feathers, where she worked with Merian C. Cooper. She made an easy transition to sound, her lovely presence and vulnerability boosting many early talkies from average to worth watching. Her importance to the success of King Kong is often not given its full due due to the staggering technical achievements behind the camera, often overshadowing everything else. Wray is simply wonderful at the beginning of King Kong, making viewers fall in love with her Ann Darrow long before Kong appears. If this was only an extraordinarily polished jungle adventure, it would be a film classic simply on the basis of Wray's performance and a timeless 1930's sense of style and adventure. With the added element of King Kong, a fearsome beast protective of something too beautiful to allow harm to come to it, it became one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong is Carl Denham, a filmmaker known for his exciting tales of adventure. A ship bound for a mysterious location only known to Denham to make a film needs only a bit of romance to satisfy the studio. Finding the lovely Ann Darrow about to pass out from hunger during the depression is a stroke of luck for the brash director. Ann is suspicious of Denham's proposal at first, but hunger and his enthusiasm, and his assurance that there are no strings attached, give Ann hope that her luck has changed. Fay Wray is wonderful in these early moments, which often get forgotten amidst the thrilling adventure encountered in the later half of the story. She endears herself to the audience early on and cements our affection for Ann once onboard. Bruce Cabot is excellent as John Driscoll, weary of having a woman onboard but soon falling in love with Anne just as viewers have. Their romance is sweet, filled with the innocent love of the era that has a timeless appeal.<br /><br />It has been breezy fun for the viewer until the ship is west of Sumatra. Denham reveals a map he has obtained in Singapore pinpointing an uncharted island where legends of a high wall and a beast called Kong are said to exist. As they approach Skull Island adventurous fun gives way to fog shrouded waters and jungle drums. The high wall does indeed exist, and after a scrape with natives enamored of Ann they find themselves confronted by a world untouched by time. Great beasts from prehistoric times roam the jungles of the island, Kong the most fearsome of all, ruling his kingdom from a high cliff where he will take Ann. Harrowing action and thrills ensue as Jack tracks his love after Kong disposes of everyone else but Carl to protect his lovely prize. The special effects still offer excitement but it is the story which makes this film such a classic. We are rooting for Jack to rescue Ann just as in the best serials, only this is no serial, but rather a topflight production creating an astounding adventure heretofore unseen in theatres.<br /><br />A gripping escape over a cliff edge will lead to Kong's demise when he follows Ann and is captured by Carl. Billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the flash of cameras perceived by Kong as an attack on his Ann creates chaos in the streets when he breaks free, leading to perhaps the most famous ending in film history. High above the New York skyline, atop the Empire State Building, Ann will find herself in the arms of the man who loves her when Kong faces down dangers he never had in the jungle. It is both romantic and bittersweet. Max Steiner's score, a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose which perfectly balances romance and adventure, and sterling photography from Eddie Linden, Veronica Walker, and J.C. Taylor make this a memorable experience.<br /><br />Though Fay Wray is terrific in this film, it is a shame that many viewers only know her from King Kong. Born in Canada but raised in the United States, she was a big supporter of events held at the Empire State Building over her lifetime, and after her passing, the lights of that landmark were dimmed for fifteen minutes in her memory. King Kong is perfect viewing for a lazy Saturday and if you haven't seen it in some time, or perhaps never seen it, it is much more than you might have imagined. A lovely way to remember Fay Wray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>Saturday afternoons were made for great adventure yarns, and serials dating all the way back to the silent era played upon our love of a rousing good jungle story, filled with danger and the thrill of discovery, with just enough romance thrown in to suggest love sprung from such exciting endeavors.

This is a black and white movie with very impressive special effects.  It stars Robert Armstrong, Bruce Cabot, and scream queen Fay Wray as Kong's female obsession.  This movie has it all - a giant ape, a good looking damsel in distress, a lost isle with dinosaurs and native inhabitants, and New York City.<br /><br />I like the 1976 remake, but nothing beats the original.  Haven't seen the 2005 Peter Jackson remake.  Some of the things I noticed about the 1933 movie is that Tyrannosaurus Rex walks completely upright.  This is the old school way of thinking.  In recent decades it has been suggested that T Rex probably walked hunched over, with its back pretty much parallel to the ground.  This shows how old this movie is, but at the same time it's fascinating to see this.  At times Kong appears two dimensional, but this is completely acceptable because this was 1933 technology.  Kong fights and kills several dinosaurs, including T Rex, a raptor, and a serpent-like creature.  The battle between Kong and T Rex is epic and goes on for quite some time.  You'll also see a Stegosaurus and a Brontosaurus, although Kong does not battle either one.  When Kong is brought to New York City, he escapes captivity and goes on a rampage.  The finale to the movie where Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State Building and battles biplanes that are shooting at him is classic.<br /><br />Compared to Jessica Lange in the 1976 version, Fay Wray is pretty much terrified of Kong for the whole movie, whereas Jessica Lange warmed up to him quite a bit.<br /><br />Special features of this DVD include audio commentary by Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston (visual effects) and interpolated interview excerpts of producer and director Merian C. Cooper and Fay Wray.  This movie has been restored and digitally mastered for a clear picture and sound.<br /><br />If you want to watch a classic monster/horror movie that is still well respected three quarters of a century after its release, then see the original King Kong.  I first saw it on TV when I was probably five years old and I still think its great.  So will you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of stop motion effects and what better example of this process than King Kong! Harryhausen would take over as king of Stop Motion, but without Kong, there would be no Harryhausen!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies of all time and the DVD is nothing short of spectacular! Not being old enough to have seen this iconic film in a theater, I was finally able to watch it in my home theater on a 10 foot screen! As the movie began I was amazed how clear the print was and I noticed little things I had never seen before. This is pretty amazing considering I've seen this film over 100 times. The sound is mono, but it's very clear and would be hard to really improve on this. The film holds up amazingly well and is the definitive giant monster movie!<br /><br />King Kong is the ultimate adventure film and I doubt it will ever be surpassed. One of the most intriguing things about this film is that Kong is a rampaging monster and never steps out of character, but in the end when he's being attacked on top the Empire State building, you can't help but feel sorry for him! Never has an eighteen inch puppet ever evoked so much sympathy! It truly is a masterpiece and I can't even imagine never seeing this film!?<br /><br />The second disc in loaded with wonderful bonus features including two long and interesting documentaries. I bought the box set which includes the original Mighty Joe Young and Son of Kong on separate discs, which are sold separately for those who only want certain films in this set.<br /><br />All three films are great examples of Stop Motion, so it's an essential set for fans of the genre. The set includes the same 2 disc special edition of King Kong and two other classic stop motion films! All the films have been re-mastered and look better than ever!<br /><br />I know that many were disappointed that the original "spider" sequence was not included on the Kong set, but the footage has yet to be unearthed! They did the next best thing and it is interesting to see the re-constructed scene.<br /><br />I had reviewed this film several years ago, but somehow it disappeared!?</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>but a major event in American movie history.  Friday evening, March 24, 1933, was when the motion picture changed forever.  A movie with horror, romance, action, adventure, and full of trills.

With the 60th Anniversary edition, there is an extra 25 minutes of documentary about the making of King Kong. This is one of the best monster movies of all times. It has everything; drama, the damsel in distress, King Kong fight different dinosaurs, the adventurer, lost live, big ape falling in love with blonde woman, and a touch of comedy to go with it. The best part about this movie is the special effects. For its day was high tech. This is a must for any monster\ape fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I just saw this again on TCM, and the surprising thing about this film is that despite the fact that it's over 70 years old, its power hasn't diminished at all.  Despite 2 remakes and countless parodies (The Simpson is especially fond of parodying this film), it is still a great motion picture.  It is very intense and surprisingly terrifying, especially in the uncut version.  Despite the "advances" in SFX today, these effects don't feel dated, because you're so drawn into the story, and you really care about the characters.  Fay Wray and Carl Denham are real people, not just stock characters reading movie lines (ironically, Denham is a film producer here).  The scenes where Kong battles prehistoric creatures are unnerving and still unsettling even today (in some reissues, these scenes were cut, but have been restored for all subsequent DVD editions).<br /><br />As much as I admire Peter Jackson, I cannot understand why he would want to remake/"reimagine" this film, as it is his favorite film.  He is an excellent filmmaker (the scope of the Lord of the Rings films is amazing, and he should commended for that), but how can you remake something you love?  I don't understand it at all, and especially when the original film has so much force, power, and depth to it.  It's like remaking The Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind.<br /><br />Regardless, the original King Kong is magnificent, one of those movie classics that more than lives up to its reputation.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Possibly one of the best movies ever made.

But the new 2005 version has a more passive Kong than this origional.  But what am i saying the origionals are always better.  This is Kong remastered as you've never seen it before, amazing set amazing movie!</p></br></body></html>
