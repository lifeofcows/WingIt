Bigotry is an ever-growing boorishness in our society and young Americans are easily induced into believing that one sex or one race is better than the other. It is scary to think that one man alone can be responsible for such wide-spread hatred, but this movie only proves that you need but a few people of similar thinking to spread the word and build your biased militia. The story is told through the eyes of Derek Vinyard's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), an impressionable adolescent who idolizes his brother's power of persuasion and blindly consigns to his discriminatory views. <p>Derek (Edward Norton) has reasonable predisposed opinions of African-Americans: his firefighting father was murdered by one of them while sousing a blaze in an impoverished quarter of Venice Beach, California. From the immediate point of this personal tragedy, his vocation is to spread the belief that foreigners and ethnics are given more rights than hard-working, white Protestants and the solution is now in the hands of the victims: themselves. Thus under the headship of well-known white supremacist Cameron Alexander, Derek builds his legion of racist devotees, deftly christening his growing gang of disillusioned teens the &quot;D.O.C.&quot;. The consequences of these beliefs take a powerful impact on his family when he guns down two Crips trying to steal his truck and is incarcerated for three years. During this time, his fledgling organization continues cultivating under the supervision of Cameron whilst Danny is swallowed into the chaos and adheres to Derek's corrupt ideals.  <p>Through his junket in a maximum-security prison, his fellow inmate in the laundry happens to be a young black man interned for a false charge of assault. He breaks down the towering wall of stereotypes that surround his race, making Derek realize his beliefs were largely askew and that he had dissapatedly influenced many innocent people, more importantly his brother. As soon as he is paroled, he is on a mission to sway Danny from the neo-Nazi crew that he himself formulated and to unlearn the harmful ethics he so vigorously preached. This proves to be a difficult task as Danny has been completely conditioned by the fascist agenda of the D.O.C., posing a grueling solution: Derek must confront Cameron and confess to Danny the agonizing incident that induced his miraculous epiphany behind bars.<p>Edward Furlong is excellent here, showing there is a deeper acting power lurking in him than such flops as &quot;Brainscan&quot;, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Pet Sematary II&quot;. He plays his character with impressive range and doesn't inflate Danny's Nazi disposition to a ridiculous degree and balances his emotional outbursts to an acceptable median. Beverly D'Angelo and newcomer Jennifer Lien turn in top-notch performances as Derek's distraught mother Doris and his educated, fiercely liberal sibling Davina. I have to say I was surprised to see Ethan Suplee as Derek's narrow-minded companion Seth after the bawling dimwit he played in Kevin Smith's critical flop &quot;Mallrats&quot;. Some other famous faces included Stacy Keach as the indomitable Cameron Alexander, Avery Brooks as the laissez-faire counselor Bob Sweeney, and the former Mr. Streisand Eliot Gould as the Jewish boyfriend Murray. Who I was not surprised to see playing the brainwashed girlfriend Stacey is Fairuza Balk, a veteran of such bizarre films as &quot;Return To Oz&quot;, &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; and &quot;The Craft&quot;. She definetely fits the character description with her willingness to buzz her raven locks and wear unattractive appliques to the most noticeable parts of her face. She's one in a million, and I have to say she was wonderful.<p>Who really turns this film and its audience upside down is Edward Norton. A colossal performance anchoring this recycled theme, Edward brings the stereotypical skinhead to life with horrifying realism, pushing the limits with Derek's loutish temperament and blissful ignorance. He spews the Nazi-esque propaganda with nary a flaw or pause, his powerful preaching frightening convincing at times. I found myself nodding my head in agreement in the scene where he complained about &quot;border jumpers&quot; vying for American jobs and the citizens of our country receiving inadequate support in their growing poverty because of invading foreigners. I thought how incredible it was that I had been swayed as easily as his audience of teenagers on these issues, but not on others (believing I am supreme because I'm a Catholic Caucasian). This is a sign of an amazing writer, one who harbors an autocratic power that is channeled through this mesmerizing and credible character.<p>Tony Kaye's artistic brilliance lent this film an emotive and metaphorical leg, curbing the abhorrent pretense with ingenious merit and poetic essence. The black and white segments are purposely applied to convey the mindset of its protaganist. The film finishes with the full-color portions of the beach, suggesting to the audience that everyone (characters and viewers) is illuminated as a result. Many complained that this artsy approach hampered the grisly subject matter, but I think it balanced a delicate scale of mindless violence by reintroducing humanity with our fragile existences. Overall, &quot;American History X&quot; shows us that violence is an infinite circle that traverses far and wide but always comes back to haunt us.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>AMERICAN HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well-acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past. The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic. And so goes this film...<br /><br />Based on the true-life story of a white supremacist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a>), the story leads us down a path many would probably not rather see, but must see in order to understand what hateful ignorance lay in wait in America (and beyond).<br /><br />After killing some black men trying to break into his car, Derek is sent to prison for several years, leaving his family to fend for themselves. Most notable is impressionistic brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who practically worships brother Derek. In high school, Danny taunts students of color and creates a few enemies that will ultimately be his undoing.<br /><br />Trying to save both Derek and Danny is high school principal Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), a black man on a mission to salvage the men from hatred (a great role for Brooks, too, second only to Norton's amazing performance).<br /><br />In prison, Derek learns a humbling lesson: those that are supposed to be your friends can be your worst enemies, and true friends can be color-blind. Derek becomes friends with an unlikely laundry buddy ...who happens to be black. The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk. Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color. Derek has awakened to his loss of hatred of colored people (and Jews), and realizes that he has to try and save brother Danny from a similar fate.<br /><br />But can he...<br /><br />Edging his way back into the family, Derek distances himself from his disturbing past, but will it be in time to save his beloved skinhead brother?<br /><br />Without a doubt, the film's ending can be viewed as fatalistic. We don't know what Derek is going to do but we are left with an inkling of hope that he'll stay true on his new path. Whether he would or not is left up to the audience to decide.<br /><br />Which is why I remained sitting, staring at a black screen after the credits finished rolling. I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true; to see Derek rise up and defeat his demons. I didn't want to see what `might' happen.<br /><br />I hope...<br /><br />An incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption ...with a terrible cost.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>This movie rocked the nation when it came out. It's the film that put Edward Norton(Incredible Hulk, The 25th Hour, The Score) on the radar.<br /><br />The movie is a statement about racism, family and hate. Anyone that has seen this movie, can relate in one way or another. It makes you think about what you've done, what you've said and where that hate comes from. Everyone can take something away from this film, some lesson, some meaning.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays a racist, he goes to prison and when he gets out, his younger brother Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Brainscan, Jimmy and Judy) is just like him. A racist full of unbridled hate for no good reason. Norton is healed, no longer a racist, matured and past that stage of his life, he tries to get his brother help and the movie escalates from there, twisting and turning, until the dramatic climax.<br /><br />A classic, everyone should see this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>I was eager to see this film before it got released, simply by virtue of the fact that Edward Norton was going to star, and the extremely sensitive nature of the film (given it's subject matter).  <p>I wasn't disappointed--and it's easy to see why this film wasn't nominated for more academy awards (the politics of it made it impossible to win); we're admiring this film by the performances within.  Edward Furlong is negligible as always, but Beverly D'Angelo does an underrated turn as the Vinyards' widowed mother, and Steacy Keach (previously blackballed in Hollywood due to an earlier high-publicity cocaine bust) is very effective as the leader of the white supremacist organization.<p>The film is uncompromising in it's violence--some might say it's gratuitous or simply too visceral--but the choice to shoot its flashback scenes in black and white is brilliant, not just for the symbolism, but also for the starkness of each actor's performance.<p>Avery Brooks is himself; no more, no less, but that's fine, because Edward Norton is the real attraction of this film.  I wouldn't say it's his best performance, but it was certainly worthy of an academy award nomination.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>How terrifying is it while listening to some of Edward Norton's rants in this movie....that you actually begin to understand his point of view on things?  That's a very important aspect of this film.  The hatred spewing from his mouth along with statistical evidence and insightful rhetoric places the viewer amist what seems to be an actual white supremicist rally.  It becomes easy to see how so many fall into crowds like this with characters like the fictional Derrick Vinyard preaching to the masses.  Many people don't like the way the world around them is.  They're looking for a  change.  People like Vinyard offer a path to that change.<p>But this story is mainly about redemption.  The redemption of the character in question, Derrick Vinyard.  Only after he loses everything can he begin to see the horrible path that he has beaten for his younger brother who is speedily chasing after him.  The unlikely friendship with a black prison inmate and the tutalage of his former principle are what helps him return to his humanity.  The simple yet distanced solution to all the hatred and anger that he's felt most of his life comes like an epiphany:  "It's just not worth it."  A point that he vehemently drives into those around him.<p>Be forwarned, this is not a happy story.  The ending is tragic yet depressingly real.  Hatred becomes a vicious circle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Edward Norton gives an extraordinarily brilliant (and Oscar nominated) performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead in this explosive and powerful drama about two brothers caught up in a cycle of racial hatred and violence. Told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, superbly portrayed by Edward Furlong, this is the story of a family torn apart after the loss of their firefighter father, killed whilst working in a black neighbourhood. As a result, the highly intelligent Derek (Norton), already influenced by his late father's bigotry and manipulated by cowardly fascist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) becomes the charismatic leader of a local gang of skinheads. This inevitably leads to friction within Derek's family and his imprisonment for the murder of two black youths. Whilst in prison hero-worshipping Danny (Furlong) seeks to emulate his older brother and becomes more and more involved with the white power movement and influenced by Cameron (Keach) and his mindless morons. However, with a hero's welcome being planned for Derek's release from prison, he returns to his neighbourhood a changed man and sets out to repair the damage he's done to his family and to persuade his brother not to travel the same road.<p>Brilliantly written by David Mc.Kenna and with top-notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred. It does not seek to sensationalise rascism or violence but neither does it duck the issues. Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence. This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama. Described by the critics as "magnificent", "extraordinary" and "outstanding" American History X genuinely is a must see movie and a must own DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>I have to admit that given the story I really didn't want to see this movie.  Recommended it by a friend I eventually sat down to watch it.  When I did I was completely mesmerised.  It takes an incredibly difficult premise and manages to make it credible, evocative and tragic.  It's basically about a member of a white supremacy group, Edward Norton, who goes to prison for three years after killing three car theifs in a race attack.  Told through the eyes of his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, as he begins to follow in the footsteps of his brother.  The movie takes a look at Norton's time in prison, his return and his effect on those around him.<p>'American History X' certainly doesn't shy away from some of its key moments and is highly graphic, so be warned.  Never before have I watched such horrible sights of brutality and been moved to such an extent, some scenes are just so horrible that you will find yourself crying out.  This makes it even more hard-hitting, and its message is a lot more complicated than 'racism is bad'.  It talks about the effect of society on a disillusioned youth population, racial friction and the family unit.<p>Thanks to Edward Norton's brave, compelling performance, the audience is really dragged into his emotional turmoil.  His performance is unflinching, refusing to cop out and go for the sympathetic vote.  He's backed up by strong performances from Edward Furlong (the kid from 'Terminator 2') and Fairuza Balk (a much underrated actress whose formidable acting ability is yet again proved here) as his girlfriend.<p>This is a movie that has several levels to it.  It's touching, horrific and serves up some troubling issues about the society that we live in.  'American History X' is a movie that everyone should see, and is one of only two movies (the other being 'Heavenly Creatures') that affected me to great depth.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Well, it's pretty violent and about every third word starts with F, but it's an important story, and based on a true story. I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories.<br /><br />Derek Vinyard is a hate-filled white supremicist, a skinhead with a huge swastika tattooed on his chest. One night he's banging his girlfriend when his younger brother Danny notices the sound of someone breaking into Derek's truck. He looks out his bedroom window and there's a black guy trying to rip off the truck. He interrupts Derek's activities to tell him, and Derek goes out in his underwear with his semi-automatic weapon and guns down the thief and one accomplice. One of them is not dead, and raises his arm begging for mercy. The audience does not see until later how Derek responded.<br /><br />But Danny saw. Danny idolized his older brother and shaved his head, too. He also had several tattoos. Most of the story is told in flash-backs from the day Derek is released from prison and comes back to his largely dysfunctional family.<br /><br />Derek changed while he was in the prison at Chino, and I was just glad that the credit was not given to religion. Instead, his English teacher (later principal of the school when Danny is there) is the one who deserves some of the credit. I'm not going to tell you who else gets the credit for turning Derek into a decent fellow.<br /><br />When Danny turned in a history paper all about Adolf Hitler, his teacher (who used to date his mother) goes to the principal and wants him thrown out. The principal is not prepared to give up on Danny, and tells him that from now on he will be Danny's history teacher. They will call the class American History X, and Danny's first assignment is to write an essay all about his brother and his influence on him and on the community.<br /><br />Not gonna tell you any more. You just have to see it develop. Grit your teeth about the language and the violence; it's about some hard issues that are very real.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>American History X instantly slaps the viewer in the face with a ferocious barrage of hate and brutality.

He should be so proud, but alas, if theres one thing that prison has tought him it's that he was there for a reason...he was wrong.  This film has so much heart and soul it's a shame that there are still those who don't see it for what it really is.  You have a man who knows only one way to feel, and due to experiences in his life he feels he is justified, and throughout the movie, while listening to Derrik rant and rave you will start to see where he's coming from.  It may be scary to admitt, but then again it's not when you see the life he lived and the adverse effects childhood trauma can have on someone, regardless of rights and wrongs.  It's like when a man, abused relentlessly by his father turns around and abuses another child.  There's no justifying the crime, it's WRONG, but you can start to break down the reason's as to why.  That's what this film does, it breaks down the reasons as to WHY there is so much hate today and why people feel the way they do.  The key to this film is that you can't blame the world for what one person has done...and you can't blame a race for the jack@$$ decitions of a few.  Derrik realizes this after spending his time in prison, realizing that there is good and bad in all races, even whites, and that you can't hold a nametag over the heads of every minority you see just because the ones you know are @$$holes...It's a timely lession because we all do it.  Stereotypes are so common that he blacks will make comments in regards to there own stereotypes and whites will do the same.  We all cast judgment because of a few instances and thus make it harder for each coming generation to make there own choice as to how to feel.  We are molding our youths to feel the hatred we keep inside by the comments we make under our breath or the jokes we make when in mixed company.  EVERYONE does it, but what this movie does so well at showing is the HORRID outcome that can happen if we don't learn as a society to accept one another.  We should not hate a race but hate an action.  Don't hate every african-american because the ones on your street seel crack and gang beat your brother...don't hate whites because your brother was harrased at school by the class racist...There is good in bad in every race, culture, religion...you name it it's there...but the bottom line is that with the bad there is the good and we as humans only have to dig so far before we find it.  Edward Norton deserved that oscar hands down, no if ands or buts because with his POWERHOUSE of a performance he made me a beliver...a beliver in the fact that anyone can change what they feel and with enough effort and love we can make a differnce in the lives we effect!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>While bringing up an important lessons about the wringness on neo Nazism & white supremacy, the over 'touchy feely'' and 'we're here to teach you a lesson'attitude of the film, using your standard Hollywood techniques (such as black & white flashbacks) was a little offputting.<br /><br />On the other hand, the performances (especially by Edward Norton), the direction & the storytelling made up for it quite well.<br /><br />The story starts in the present - Danny Vineyard (Edward Furlong) is in trouble at school again, because he wrote an assignment that sheds heroic light on Adolf Hitler. While his history teacher (a Jew who we later learn had dated Danny's mother, but was driven off by the rest of the family's attitude) would like to see him expelled for good, the school principal (who happens to be black) would like to give him another chance - and gives him an assignment - to write a paper on the effect his older brother has had on his life.<br /><br />The older brother, Derek (Edward Norton) has been a bright kid, but turned into a 'skin head' neo nazi at a certain point in highschool - and things just got worse & worse until Derek has been incarcerated for killing a black man who tried stealing his car. Being charismatic, he's the most dominant member of his neo nazi gang - led by an older man (Stacy Keach) who doesn't like to get his hands dirty, so he lets the boys (led by Derek) to do it for him. Danny is also affected by Derek's rhetoric, and turns into a skin head himself when Derek isn't home.<br /><br />While writing his assignment, Danny flashes back into the family's history, trying to undertand why his older brother went for the white supremacy rhetoric in the first place, and hears his brother's "change of heart in jail" story (that may be a little too graphic), when trying to save his little brother from a fate he now understand is wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>American History X stands on its own as a great piece of powerhouse performing by all the cast involved, including - Norton, Furlong, Keach, Brooks, D'Angelo and Gould. Essentially the story is about Derek (Norton) who plays an ex-Nazi gang leader who undergoes rehabilitation while in prison where he gets to experience the cons of his fascism. The film tells his story through the eyes of his brother (Furlong) who must write a paper for his principle on his brother's life as punishment for writing an essay on Adolf Hitler. <p>The film poses a number of great questions and answers many of them, although we will never actually get to see the REAL American History X because Kaye was locked out of the editing room, by Hollywood executives and Norton, in an attempt to control Norton's content on the screen and to give it a Hollywood flavor which can be seen throughout the picture when Norton does the sudden U-Turn with the Nazi brother and suddenly become "good guys" almost overnight. Yes, it is hard to believe at times and certainly there is a lot to spoon down in that department, but overall the film is certainly very good and plays out well even if the story is a bit contrived at times, however you will LOVE the cinematography that Kaye produces on the screen and this film does indeed look lush in its color, black and white, slow motion sequences. <p>Definitely a picture worth looking at - to look at, and although the story does have a lot of impact it might be a little artificial in a Hollywood sort of way at times. Pitty Kaye was not allowed the reigns all the way through to the finish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>The first few minutes of AHX are intended to horrify and shock you, to show the callousness of people who hate other people simply because of racial or ethnic stereotypes that have been blindly forced upon them.  Edward Norton really shows off his acting chops as he transforms from a bigoted, murderous neo-Nazi to a gentle, rehabilitated older brother trying to prevent his impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following in his misguided footsteps.<p>The film is both uplifting and tragic, as well as brutally realistic.  Without spoiling the ending for anyone who has not seen the film, Norton's pain and guilt will linger with you long after the credits roll.  Yet from all the tragedy of the hate and violence that consume the characters in this film comes a ray of hope--with the guidance of Dr. Bob Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) Norton's character, and ultimately Furlong's character, both have small victories in overcoming the cycle of hate.  The ending of the film reminds us, however, that we still have a long way to go in race relations in America.<p>Beverly D'Angelo, Elliot Gould, Stacey Keach, and Fairuz Balk also play convincing supporting roles in this powerful drama that is well worth watching.  Although it is certainly not intended for young children with its violence and graphic rape, AHX is one of those films that should be mandatory for older teens (17-18), especially those who might be pre-disposed to hate a certain religious or ethinic group due to their environment.  As another reviewer aptly stated: "hate is learned and can be unlearned."  The un-learning of hate is precisely what this film is all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is released from prison to find his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) caught in the same web of racism and hatred that landed him in prison.  The movie centers around Derek, a man who has gone through experiences in his life that have led to him becoming an extremely hateful racist and anti-semitist. His father being shot by a black man is what sparks the change in him and his anger drives his life to a Neo-Nazi world that he ultimately ends when he murders two black men. His experiences in prison make him realize how much of his life he has wasted and his new goal in life is to save his brother from taking the same wrong path he did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>Wow! I can't believe that nobody talks about this movie. I rented it having heard nothing about it, but since I've seen it, I've told everybody about it. Edward Norton delivered an increadible performance as a repentant skinhead. This was truly an amazing movie. It is Norton's best role, which says a lot because he's always great (Fight Club, Rounders, The Score, 25th Hour). This is certainly not a movie that everybody can handle. Before you view, understand that it has an extreme R rating, which is for strong brutal violence (including a graphic rape), pervasive extreme language, and sexuality (including some brief nudity). This is not exactly your feel good movie either, so be prepared. Don't watch this with your elementary age kids. American History X is an extremely hard core movie that reflects hard core life styles. It is unforgettable and will have a powerful impact on you.</p></br><a href="../users/AS7B4W4KOPQNV.html">AS7B4W4KOPQNV</a><br/><p>Edward Norton could probably play anyone, he is one of the best actors out there.  In this film, he stars as a leader of a neo-nazi group.  His father was killed a few years earlier, and Norton is a very angry and bitter person now.  His behavior is tearing apart the family, and he soon gets arrested for murder.  While in jail, he changes his views and no longer wants to be a skin-head in the neo-nazi group.  When he getys out of prison, he leaves the group and everyone turns against him.  He's in all kinds of trouble then.  This movie is very powerful and the performances are just incredible.

I think whoever edited this piece knew what an audience would associate most with the characters and made the film successful.

The array of emotions he projected before and after his reformation left me speechless. He's an actor in the truest sense of the word.<p>Yes, like I've said before, this movie is difficult to watch, but my advice is to look beyond the hatred, name-calling, and violence and discover the message the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>AMERICAN HISTORY X is a film that definitely makes you think. If you live in a city it makes wonder what motivates people to do what they do and how they could perform such acts of violence. If you live in rural America you wonder the same thing but are glad you don't have neighborhood rival gangs around your home. Directed by Tony Kaye - the only film I know he has done to date - there is a sense of satisfaction with the completely sad ending of this film.<p>Edward Norton does a phenomenal job as playing a kid, Derrick Vinyad growing up against all odds being thrown at him and going through the judicial system - and failing. Failing his family. After growing up in gangs and violence Edward's character goes to prison and threw several reform programs only to learn that his childhood was never a childhood. The help of Avery Brooks', Dr. Bob Sweeney, and the two travel a road down LA streets that would scare even the most indignant criminals.<p>The photography is cleverly don the best part about the film is the kid playing Edwards brother, played by Edward Furlong, gives an incredible performance right until the end. The ending is shocking and almost disgusting - but the emotional impact is very real.<p>There are not many DVD extra's on this one. There is no commentary which I would have liked to have heard from the director because apparently what I had heard is that he didn't like the studio cut of the film and filled a law suite to New Line in 1998 about not letting him use his pseudonym "Humpty Humpty" because he didn't like the final version of his film that New Line cut for him. Either way - this is a good film, but certainly not for kids under high school age - however, I think High School freshmen, should watch this for their own safety.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>This film is a master piece!

Part of me was going "ya!" and part of me was ashamed.We will always have hatred in america. Those who say they do not hate are phonys. I do have hate but seeing this film it gives hate a place to put that hate on a shelf. You WILL learn from this film and that is exactly the message that this film has. We are here on earth to learn and this movie is a wonderful example of how to learn to control and understand the people we fear. Give this film a change, you will learn alot about people and about yourself. As far as the acting? Hats off to Ed Norton! He's a rare Hollywood talent who has all my respect. He knows his craft and is excellent at it. The supporting cast is also equally as good. This is a very powerful movie and hope that it is listed as a very important film in the 20th/21st Century.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>this was a powerful film that sent a real tough but good message out about hate groups. in the end it comes back to haunt the ones involved. i was truly saddened by the ending of the film and hoped that wouldnt have happened.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>A Ex-Neo Nazi Skinhead (Edward Norton in a strong, believable performance) returns home to his middle-class family.

Grade:A.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Wow! What a movie! I was nervous about this movie, because I thought it might be too much for me. Well, I finally saw it. It was very disturbing and moving and is a masterpiece. The movie is excellent with powerful performances notably by Edward Norton. Where's his oscar? Why'd Roberto Benigni get it? Edward was robbed!<br /><br />The movie is very powerful and moving and has a very sad and tragic ending. The movie is so sad because it is depicting reality. The watcher sees these skinheads and how awful they are. But, then you think about some of Edward Norton's statements and how they're maybe true. This makes you think a lot. The movie is about the leader of the skinheads, Derek (Edward Norton) who is sent to jail for killing some black guys trying to steal his car. His brother Donny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path as Derek but once Derek is released, he is a changed man. He feels bad for what he has done and wants to change. But his brother is confused and the skinheads aern't happy with their ex leader. The movie is so powerful and moving and shows the remarquable transformation of a mean and angry man into a kind and caring man.<br /><br />This movie is one of my favorites ever and I recommend it to everyone. It's not for light hearted people but this needs to be seen. This is an amazing movie that EVERYONE should see. You'll cry, turn your head away in disgust and might even get 1 or 2 laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I finally got around to seeing American History X tonight after hearing much good hype and it was a great film dealing with ugly issues. Edward Norton deserved the Oscar he was nominated for and I would say this is easily his best performance, followed closely by Fight Club and Primal Fear. Edward Furlong, better known as the whiny kid who played John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is surprisingly very good here as well. This is one of those movies that I am mad I spent money to rent when I could own this great film for around $10.00. People of all races should see this realistic film dealing with the "stuff" few like to discuss in public, but can still be seen throughout the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>if crash wanted to be a great film about racism (and earn that so called oscar) they should have done it like american history x did. unlike crash, history dosent force racism on the screen but instead fires it when necesary. norton truley gives an outstanding performance, looking buff and mean with a swastika on his chest, norton should have gotten that oscar and furlong really redeems himself in this film and everyone else in the film gave great performences. the film tells of a brutal skinhead who is sent to jail after he murders two black men, while in jail, he learns the error of his ways as he be-friends a black man and uncovers the truth about his racist ways. when he gets out, he tries to make ammends with the people he's hurt and convince his brother to not go down the same path he went. switching back from black and white flash backs to present day, the film really flips you view on racism and when norton starts shouting actual racist truth, its scary. great film and if i were haggis, he should of modeled after this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>It's probably not surprising that so young an actor as Edward Norton did not get an Oscar for his riveting performance in AMERICAN HISTORY X back in 1998.  Actors in the 20s, usually get passed over on the assumption that they've got plenty of time to prove themselves over the course of their careers.  (I believe Adrien Brody's recent win for THE PIANIST made him the youngest winner ever--and he was pushing 30 by that point.)  Of course, cinema historians may find Norton's loss to the now somewhat discredited Roberto Benigni particularly galling (at least give it to Nolte or McKellan who were also up for the award that year--but Benigni fever, however benign it was, was running rampant that year and dictated otherwise).<br /><br />Norton's performance, as is generally acknowledged, is a tour-de-force.  Aside from his age, the other thing that worked against him as far as recognition from the Academy goes was the disturbing nature of the film.  Many reviewers have noted that the very articulateness with which Norton's character Derek expounds his racist views is downright scary.  One cannot dismiss him--as one can with nearly all of his neo-Nazi colleagues--as a complete ignoramus.  Even the supposedly canny and diabolically charismatic group leader, Cameron (Stacy Keach) is pretty much a cypher.  At the very least, Keach needed more screen time to establish why he was able to exert such a hold over Venice Beach's alienated white youth.  Do such groups really rely on middle aged Nazi gurus for inspiration?<br /><br />The failure to develop Keach's character is only one of many dramatic flaws--many of which have been detailed by other reviewers below and elsewhere.  The relatively short term (three years) that Derek serves in prison seems unlikely.  His in-prison conversion, mainly through the influence of a black inmate who befriends, him is certainly plausible, but also a little cliched.  The outreach efforts of a former teacher, also African-American, rings a bit truer but is also a bit dramatically suspect.  Finally, one could argue that someone as intelligent as Derek would not be so quick to reveal his change of heart to potentially dangerous former colleagues without first having made some provisions for his family's and his own safety and security.<br /><br />In short, there are gaps in the plot that you could drive a semi through.  That does not make the film--and Norton's performance--anything less than gripping, however.  The film's ending, which some may find a bit heavy handed, at least serves to remind the viewer that neither Derek's moral transformation not that of his younger brother (which Derek has begun to help effect) can prevent tragedy.  It is a final, powerful reminder that the cycle of hate is nearly impossible to break.<br /><br />For those who might be doing some programming or who simply like to do their own in-house double bills, consider running this film along with Mathieu Kassovitz's equally hard hitting HATE (LA HAINE).</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>Foremost, the controversy: the film's director Tony Kaye desperately tried divorced himself from this work when he realized that he would not be able to release the film under a false-name. Though he claims that Edward Norton edited the film to allot himself more screen time, most believe there is something deeper at work here.<br /><br />Equally as interesting: this film's script-ending is dramatically different from the end-product. To avoid spoilers, check the bottom of IMDB's trivia for this film for the shocking details!! (Though this conclusion is alluded to in the actual film-ending, it is made blatant in the script).<br /><br />If for some strange reason "Fight Club," "Red Dragon," "Death to Smoochy," and "Primal Fear" did not convince you that Norton has TREMENDOUS range, this film will. Not only did Norton physically transform himself for this role by gaining THIRTY pounds of muscle, he mentally accessed the very dark place where hatred resides. His character is all-too-believable. A credit to his talent, indeed!!<br /><br />Those who find this film only reinforces stereotypes seem to miss how the film portrays the both the irrationality of racism and its insidious nature. This is especially evident in the character of Seth. That fact the Seth refuses to eat a black jellybean because of its color paints a pretty clear picture. On the other hand, the film does not hesitate to show the viewer that many members of hate groups are intellectually gifted: like Derek and Danny. Circumstance has pushed these young men to seek a new father figure, and they find comfort in the attention provided by Cameron (leader of the fictional D.O.C. or Disciples of Christ). Chilling!<br /><br />Several people here claim the black-and-white scenes are "artsy." Entirely untrue. They have a very clear purpose: they exist simply to indicate "the past." (It is a common film-device. . . as nearly all of you reading this know). In no way does this detract from the film. In fact, it makes several graphic scenes more tolerable.<br /><br />If you are interested in film art, keep an eye on the use of the sea ... and pay specific attention to the diner-scene (near the conclusion) where Norton stands in front of a sea-scape painting . . . his head engulfed in the waves. That which was once so alive becomes frozen in time. (Read into it what you will!)<br /><br />Though there are some sexually explicit scenes, it is a great film for a college classroom or for a very mature teenager (though, if I were a parent, I would not want to watch it WITH my child). Some see the work as heavy-handed . . . I think it is quite real.<br /><br />A must-see for any Norton fan or anyone interested in human-behavior.<br /><br />Suggested Reading: Roth, Luanne.

Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, a man who has been in jail for  three years for murdering two black men. Upon his return to his family's  new apartment, the viewers learn of Derek's past involvement with the  largely-populated white supremacist gang in California. It is also made  clear that he wishes to escape his past life, to break free from the gang  that considers him to be &quot;a god.&quot; As he begins meeting his old  friends again, he discovers that his younger brother has become involved in  the gang, and throughout the movie, black-and-white flashbacks are used as  Derek's thoughts and stories used in order to convince his brother to leave  the gang before he gets himself in too deep. The film is totally violent  and utterly graphic, leaving none of the brutal aspects of the gang's  nature to the imagination. Norton and Edward Furlong, who plays the  brother, give excellent performances that add nothing but integrity and  believability to the film. While being graphic in nature, the film is a  breathtaking view of what life is like in gangs and cults, and the  life-long consequences that accompany them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>A solid, worthwile movie on its own, "American History X" falls a bit short of being a masterpiece. Tony Kaye`s directional debut is a strong piece of filmmaking, a poignant urban drama about racism and the way youth deals with it.<br /><p>The plot focuses the relationship of Derek Vinyard (an excellent Edward Norton) and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, also well cast), who live in a Californian neighborhood. Derek and his friends have strong neo-nazi convictions, an ideology that they have chosen (or were just manipulated) while were dealing with the difficult task of growing up and its common alienating process.<br />After Derek spends some time in prison, his views of society change and he becomes a more tolerant, reasonable person and struggles to get his brother away from some racist influences. Kaye knows how to deliver a gritty and realistic atmosphere, with an intriguing visual style and some tense and suspenseful moments. <p>There are a couple of brutal, strong scenes here to enhance the violence and latent danger of extreme racist actions. However, the tone of the movie is uneven, switching between a dry, dark and credible approach or a more emotional and somewhat predictable perspective. This situation is better noticed in the not too surprising ending, that almost seems like an afterschool special.<br />Despite some stereotyped moments, "American History X" is still a consistent effort, one that is both captivating and meaningful, way above most of the mind-numbing "movies" out there.<br /><p>Director Tony Kaye also deserves recognition for presenting two young racists that are not stupid, dumb, one-dimensional characters, just confused and reluctant individuals who still don`t know how to deal with their world.<br />A good, though-provoking movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>From an incredibly unknown director, "American History X" is a powerful film that brings the audience face-to-face with white supremacy.  But this is not the easily dismissed, ignorant white supremacy that is represented in so many films these days.  Rather, it is white supremacy in the mind of an extremely intelligent young man played by Edward Norton.  While anyone with reasonable intelligence can see the holes in Derek Vinyard's logic, the arguments themselves are delivered with powerful and forceful eloquence that is absolutely shocking.  Norton's performance is riveting; I am constantly amazed at the depth of his acting ability.  One is able to go from hating him to being moved by him to absolutely routing for him-all in the same film. <p>The movie is extremely graphic and moving.  "American History X" is not your typical film about racism and violence.  It manages to emerge from the rubble and provide a positive message for those of us who are left to deal with the world.  Hate is learned; one can see that in the lives of these two neo-Nazis.  But it can also be forgotten.  The most important thing, however, is to never learn to hate in the first place.  Not only does this film provide insight into the making of a racist, it empathizes with those who are unwittingly caught up in the false logic the white supremacists sell.  Many movies try to dismiss those who hate.  This film tries to understand where they are coming from and shows us how close we all are to crossing the line.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>American History X is a powerful film about a controversial and disturbing subject: racism in America. Edward Norton plays the part of Derek Vinyard, who is an intelligent young man who falls into the skinhead neo Nazi lifestyle in Venice Beach, California. Stacey Keach plays Cameron Alexander, a white supremacist based on Tom Metzger, and Avery Brooks plays Dr. Bob Sweeney, a black high school teacher who reaches out to his students, both Black and White, to try to get them to turn away from gangs, hatred, and violence.<br /><br />Edward Furlong plays Daniel Vinyard, the younger brother of Derek, who also gets involved in the neo Nazi skinhead lifestyle once his brother Derek is sent to prison. Derek shoots and murders some Black car jackers who are stealing his truck, but goes over the line in his zealotry, and is sent to prison. While in prison, he rejects racism, and when he gets out, he tries to prevent his younger brother Danny from making the same mistakes as he. But it is not that easy, it is not like a Country Club that you can just quit and walk away from.<br /><br />Finally, director Tony Kaye wanted his name removed and sued the film company for damages. Edward Norton edited the film, and gave himself a bigger role, according to Kaye, and they fell out over artistic differences. I think that the final product was very good, and I don't see why Tony Kaye didn't want to be associated with it. The film I saw was well directed and covered a very controversial subject remarkably well. I guess it is just that the subject creates very strong feelings, and it is difficult to come to an agreement about how best to convey the proper politically correct line. It was almost one of those "directed by Alan Smithee' situations, but one of the stipulations of using that pseudonym is that you don't discuss your dissatisfaction with the project in public, and Tony Kaye had already taken out ads in Variety that aired his dirty laundry and complaints.<br /><br />FILMS AND ROLES OF EDWARD NORTON<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a> (2002) ....

His almost maniacal performance is simply astounding. You can see it in his eyes, he takes this role 100% seriously. It truly is probably his best performance to date and surely worthy of the Oscar nomination. I sometimes find him to be understated, but there is no mistaking that in this film. He owns this role and he is the reason to see this film.<br /><br />That said, the film itself is nothing truly innovative or spectacular, the subject matter isn't original or shocking, but it did hook me in regardless. Again, the acting made it believable. The prison scenes were an eye opener, thought a tad on the clich&eacute; side, but I couldn't help but be moved.<br /><br />The ending, for me, almost didn't make any sense in the grand scheme of things, but I think the director ended it exaclty where it was supposed to end. In my mind, it could have gone a little longer in regards to an extended ending. Actually, doing some research, I read that a longer ending was planned, but never filmed. If it was, it would have been purely for the shock value.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone that wants a good story with wonderful performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>American History X is deeply moving, dripping with importance, and incredibly daring to say the least. What a movie this is, Norton plays a former Neo-Nazi who has just been released from prison. His younger brother played by Edward Furlong has now followed in his former footsteps, as Derrick (Norton) tries to reform his baby brother not to hate, he recalls the last several years in prison, how he was brutally raped and struck an unlikely friendship with a black inmate. The film travels between color and black and white images. The ending still gets me to this day, a movie you have to see. I highly recommend this realistic portrait of one man's determination to make right with an uncertain future and his embarrassing past.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>I have heard great things about this movie. My friends raved about it. Critics loved it. And I have always been a fan of Edward Norton. However it was just until recently that I managed to catch this movie, and I was blown away. I was expecting something good, but no way as shocking and powerful as this.<br /><br />Derek was charged with murdering 2 black guys, who were trying to steal his car. He is currently doing time in prison and we are given glimpses of his life before entering prison. He is an influential member of the skinheads. They are a racist group and believe that whites have the sole rights to flourish in the U.S. We are also shown some of the hate crimes committed by Derek and his gang as well as life in prison. These are all in short cuts until they show Derek out of prison and how he sees things differently from then on.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say bravo to the writers and the film makers for making such a bold movie. Whatever movie that deals with racism pales in comparison to this. Derek is not a mindless fool following the crowd. He has his views, his opinions about various problems the country is facing, and scary as this may sound...some of them actually makes sense. That is how profound the dialogue is. One scene in particular showcases this, a scene where the family is having dinner. Derek's mother has a friend over, Murray and they don't share his believes. They are shocked to find Derek has such hatred toward the minorities. Derek delivers some of the best lines in this scene, that you are left wondering...have you ever shared his views? If you did, does that make you a bad person? Is is true what Derek is saying, and if it is...is it fair? These are some of the questions I was left with, watching this movie.<br /><br />As good as the script is, this movie would be nothing without Edward Norton's electrifying performance. Sure, the supporting cast did a fantastic job as well, especially Edward Furlong who played Derek's brother, Danny in the movie. But this movie is undeniably Norton's. I believe that the late 90's was the pinnacle of Norton's success. He gave a superb performance in Primal Fear in 1996, followed by this in 1998 and ending the millennium with outstanding acting in Fight Club in 1999. Here, the character he plays is larger than life. He has the power to change people's perception on crimes and racial views. Putting on 30 pounds of muscle for this role, he has never looked bigger and badder than this. Every move he makes seem to accentuate hate. He feels disgusted with what his neighbourhood has become and he decides to take matters on his own hand, and do something about it. It's just that his believes have been skewed by his father, and without much self control, he spirals down to committing hate crimes. Derek is a bad-a$$ and Norton captures it perfectly. Yet, after prison...Derek experiences something completely different. He has feelings of regret over his past life. He has repent, yet can his sins really be forgiven by him not indulging himself in hate crimes? His brother is headed down the same path and the people who he recruited are now angry with him for leaving that life, they see him as an enemy. How Norton transforms himself to reflect this is really amazing. From a confident, "don't give a f*ck" attitude, he is reduced to a broken man. He feels remorse but at the same time doesn't want to shoulder the responsibility of educating his friends the wrong of his ways. He knows it won't sit well with them. This leads to the movie's final scene which suffice to say, might not really have shocked you but will leave you feeling a mixed of emotions.<br /><br />Good movies entertain, but great movies affect you on a personal level. This is an example of the later. This movie is not for everyone, but for those who are open minded and willing to take the leap, you won't be disappointed. Terrific script and brilliant acting makes this one of my favorite movies. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I saw this movie, and well, it disturbed me. Some scenes were incredibly graphic. I wanted to shield my eyes like a five year old watching a kissing scene in a movie. However, this movie is wonderful in many other ways. It has the whole This Is What Racism Is And It's Bad theme, Edward Norton does a wonderful job portraying a man who has killed because he was a racist and then fighting with the demons of the killing, and the filming technique is brilliant. I can't explain it all, so I will leave you to see this movie on your own. This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but not one that everyone will like. It's more of a movie to be respected.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;American History X&quot; is an extremely powerful and important film. It sizzles off the screen with burning intensity. Director Tony Kaye displays his talent as a filmmaker here. His cinematography, both in color  and black &amp; white, makes Venice look like a training ground for the  Apocalypse. Edward Norton gives his best performance. &quot;American  History X&quot; also studies the mechanics of racism and how it feeds into  the minds of weak-spirited individuals, how evil can blind a person's  thought processes and drive that person to committ horrible acts. The music  here is also effective and flows with the film's mood, if not enhancing it.  This is an important film, which I think, should be shown in high schools  around America. It is a powerful study of hate. I just wish that the  screenplay by David McKenna didn't try to cover so much in only a 24 hour  period. &quot;American History X&quot; would have been a classic of modern  cinema had it been at least a 3 hour piece. It doesn't go into the realm of  masterpiece as it would have been with a genius screenwriter and director  like Oliver Stone. Still, this is a powerful, important movie that everyone  should watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Anyone who thinks that the kind of fascism that led to the horrors of  Europe in the 1940s  "can't happen here" will appreciate the lessons all  too apparent in this movie. It can happen here, and a society that abandons  its youth to lives of hopelessness and impoverishment will learn the  lessons of history if it doesn't do more to rectify the causes underlying  such hate and discontent. This is a tough, gritty, and violent look at the  complex problems associated with race, poverty, and hopelessness that  pervade our inner cities and prey especially upon the young and vulnerable  teens trapped by life circumstance into these kinds of confrontations.  While George W. Bush waxes on so dreamily about his proposed Presidency not  "leaving a single child behind", the reality of the situation is quite  different; the stark economic realities of contemporary America is that  more and more urban youth are being abandoned and isolated in the midst of  all this unbelievable affluence for others. <p>The movie is set up as a  kind of morality play; Edward Norton is a newly ex-convict hoping to turn  his life around by disassociating himself from the neo-Nazi group that led  him astray into a life of hate, violence, and murder a few years before.  Still, his younger brother, played well by Edward Furlong, is fascinated by  the power and allure of the neo-Nazis. As the movie progresses, we become  more familiar with just how it is that both brothers have become so  indoctrinated by hate, and left so susceptible to the racist messages of  the extremists. All of the cast, from Norton to Furlong to Eliot Gould to a  host of others are excellent, and this gripping story of how easily hate,  distrust, and violence beget more of the same is a sorry statement of what  the not so benign neglect of the society toward its less fortunate sons and  daughters can result in. This is an excellent movie and is one I highly  recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>&quot;American History X&quot; tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a neo-nazi leader of a skinheads gang of Venice Beach, California. Derek is introduced as a racist scumbag in the first scene, when he kills a couple of black men in front of his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong); Derek is sent to prison and Danny gets so impressed with the actions of his older brother that he decides to follow his footsteps as a radical racist.<br /><br /> Then the movie is divided in two kind of scenes: the black and white scenes, the flashbacks, where we can see the past of Derek, his thoughts about every person which is different to a white American person, he hates black people, Jews, Mexicans, Asiatic people, etc., he just hates them all. And then are the color scenes, the present, where we see a new Derek, a reformed Derek, he is now ashamed of his racist past, and now he has to fight to save his brother of following his footsteps.<br /><br /> &quot;American History X&quot; is not a popcorn movie; is a powerful drama with strong scenes, strong language, and a very disturbing ending; it requires an open mind because the subjects that the story introduces to us may be controversial.<br /><br /> Edward Norton is incredible as Derek, in this movie he offers his best performance so far, and that's saying a lot. In &quot;American History X&quot; he is as impressive as Robert De Niro was in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; or as Daniel Day-Lewis was in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;. The rest of the cast is also perfect in this movie, particularly Edward Furlong as Danny. The extras on the DVD are not very good, but one of the deleted scenes is very interesting.<br /><br /> Perhaps &quot;American History X&quot; may offend some people, but open minded people will appreciate better this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG.html">A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG</a><br/><p>One afternoon while there was nothing to do I decided to go and see this film. This may be one of the biggest surprises of my life. A very well acted and made movie it tackled large subjects without flinching and not avoiding.<br />The movie stars Edward Norton as Derrick Vinvard. A former skinhead who has just been released from prison to find his brother Danny played by Edward Furlong is following in his footsteps. Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Elliot Gould and Stacey Keach are all fantastic in the supporting roles but it's both Furlong and Norton ,mostly Norton, who really have the floor in this movie.<br />The movie takes a good look at racisim, and hate and never losses it's focus. Norton is proving that he is the best young actor of this generation and he recieved a much deserved Oscar Nomination for this role. At time difficult to watch becouse of it's unflinching look into the world's of hate, prison and redemption.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>American History X takes its place among a handful of films that dare to address difficult subjects without any sugarcoating or watering down. The fact that it failed at the boxoffice is not surprising. In our modern age, what's most important it that it was made and is available for anyone who chooses to see it. <p>It is simply done, yet exquisite in its deliberate use of both black and white and color. The colors show often that the stark contrasts of black and white are often just an illusion. The world is far more complex than black, white and shades of gray can capture.<p>It is the story of an average American boy named Derek [Edward Norton in his Oscar nominated performance] who turns into a neo-Nazi skinhead. How this decision affects the lives of his younger brother Danny [Edward Furlong in his best role] and the rest of his family, not to mention the lives of others around him, is the focus of the movie. Yet it is far more than the story of a bigoted boy gone bad. It deals with the basic nature of racial hatred and plays more like a modern updating of an idea by William Shakespeare than anything else I can think of. <p>If I have any negative opinion of this film, it is that there was not time in it to fully flesh out every thing it addresses. This is a minor complaint, and is far better than films that go on and on about a thing long after we've gotten the point. <p>Edward Norton truly deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. I never though I'd see the day when Robert DiNero would have a competitor, but if it isn't Norton, then it isn't anyone. <p>Every part of this movie rang true to me - the simple, middle-class family struggling to survive, the love between brothers, the scenes in prison. Even the somewhat cruel ending makes perfect sense if you stop and really think about the beginning of the movie.<p>Anne Dudley contributed here one of the finest music scores for a movie in 1998.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>A HIGHLY INTENSE MOVIE THIS MOVIE BLOWS YOUR MIND IT IS NOW A PIECE OF HISTORY, THIS MOVIE WILL HAVE YOUR HEART POUNDING HAVE YOU ON THE END OF THE SEAT IT IS EXTREME DRAMA,,, THIS MADE ME GO OUT AND BUY EVERY EDWARD NORTON MOVIES IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!!PERIOD!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A film that is supposed to be cultish and to be anti-racist. It is true there are some interesting scenes in the first four fifths of the film. But the last part, after the nocturnal confrontation of the two brothers around what happened to Derek in prison goes its own way and leads to a message that is absolute despair. "What have I done?" says Derek on the dead body of his brother. He has in fact done nothing at all but exploited a manipulative situation that was rotten from the start and made him the victim of bigotry. But Derek was redeemed in prison. His brother was redeemed by Derek's tale of what happened to him in prison and by the black principal of the school. The two white boys were redeemed. But the black boy was not, could not be and he killed and was unerasably and permanently sprayed with the blood of his prey and the final vision of a completely red Pacific Ocean of forever waxing and waning blood leads to a meaning of fatality that will never end. Racism is forever because the black victims of white racism will never be redeemed and will never forgive. And why should they? The an eye for an eye law of this society is forever and the film suggests no way out from that eternal vengeful apocalyptic vision, not even an escape.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Edward Norton is a fabulous actor, yet his portrayal as an angry, hate-filled skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X may be his best, most powerful performance.  Norton so immerses himself in the role of a young man feeling disenfranchised from his culture and society that his racist rants take on a surreal logic all their own; one of the primary reasons this is such a disturbing film.<br /><br />The interracial interaction and tension is as volatile as it is believable, making the first half of the film extremely uncomfortable to watch.  Stacy Keach playing a cold, cunning, calculating mentor to the skinhead gang is extremely effective, and Edward Furlong is compelling as Norton's impressionable younger brother.  The brothers come from a highly dysfunctional family, matriarched by a frightened, unstable mother (Beverly D'Angelo).  Once Norton's character is sent to prison for gunning down two African Americans, AMERICAN HISTORY X takes a decided turn, as the protagonist experiences a reawakening--and a very ironic friendship.<br /><br />Upon his release our main character has a much different outlook on life, yet cannot turn his younger brother away from years of indoctrinated hate, and the film moves relentlessly toward its hopelessly tragic (and horrific) conclusion.  One does indeed reap what one sows--a powerful lesson to take from AMERICAN HISTORY X, a compelling, engrossing, yet disturbing film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>This is a powerful movie that deserves all the respect it has gained.  It does not present a simple tale of right vs. wrong, but rather puts you in the shoes of people to see how skinhead ideals (or any racist ideals) can take over, and become all-consuming, and shape your life forever.  It's not at all a preachy story of a changed man, rather it is an intense portrait of a family hit by race issues, and the stuggles of each family member to come to terms with reality and find their own personal belief system.<br /><br />The story is told in flashbacks--it opens with Edward Norton's skinhead character getting out of jail for killing a black man.  Slowly, we learn the backstory of how he got to be the skinhead leader he was, and what happend to him in prison to make him look at the world differently.  I had tears in my eyes during the prison flashback segments.<br /><br />The Norton character gives many eye-opening monologues on his skinhead ideals.  There's just enough truth in what he says to make him dangerous.  It's very easy to see how disaffected youth, bullied by gangs, could turn to the skinhead ideals as a safe haven.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie about racist ideals and family ties.  Check it out if you can handle the realism and want to be blown away by some powerful messages.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>If you are a fan of Norton buy this movie, by far his best performance.  The story is about redemption, and is highly powerful, and thought and heart provoking.  The violence isnt really that bad compared to saving private ryan, but is still shocking.  The drama is heart wrenching, and the movie makes you think.  The ending is trajec, from beginning to end you think and feel mixed emotions, but in the end you are sad but still feel good, seems strange right.  Its an very important film that explains alot, and should be viewed because it matters.  9 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>American History X is what 'Crash' failed to be, that is, a nuanced and believable exploration of the roots and manifestations of racism. The film does not lecture but nor does it pardon - it approaches its delicate subject matter with conviction, maturity and stark imagery.<br /><br />Set among the resurgence of Neo-Nazism among California's disenchanted urban youth in the 80's and early 90's, X is the story of one family, headed by eldest son Norton, and how the seed of racism takes root in his heart and begins to grow.<br /><br />Leading man Norton delivers an explosive and utterly convincing performance as a young man who's world view becomes twisted by racist convictions. Soon his festering and misdirected rage lands him in prison, where hard lessons await. Outside of the prison walls Norton's younger brother begins the cycle anew as he seeks to follow in the footsteps of the brother he has come to idolize.<br /><br />A fascinating and deeply layered tale of prejudice and the painful lessons of lives misspent in its shadow, American History X is explicitly violent but superbly performed and executed. The ending, as shocking as any I've seen in cinema, is as uncompromising as the rest of the film and will provide little comfort to happy-ending seekers. DVD includes deleted scenes, cast bios and theatrical trailer. Widescreen format is included. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>This movie is Edward Norton's movie and Norton's movie alone. The script is hackneyed melodrama. The rest of the cast is there to service a role. Fairuza Balk is cool in a freaky goth chick sort of a way. Edward Furlong doesn't speak much. Even the soundtrack is one of those grating bits of fluff that wants to tell you whenever an important part is coming. <p>The plot is very silly. Nazi skinhead goes to jail. Gets reformed. Comes out feeling very silly. His reform happens when he spends his time talking about basketball with his only friend in the laundry room.<p>Yet - I can't completely hate this movie for one reason alone - Edward Norton is one of those actors that is entirely watchable. He can play very nice or very scary and you never know where he's going to go with it. In this movie he's white kid urban rage on all barrels. He's alternately sinister and scary as he explains the tenets of Nazism and makes them sound almost reasonable. Unlike Russel Crowe who has all the intensity but only rage in &lt;b>Romper Stomper&lt;/b> you can see Norton thinking and planning. <p>Sadly he's trapped in a bad plot and that takes away much of the power. It's trying too hard to be powerful. It fails. If you want to see a serious movie about nazi skinheads watch &lt;b>The Believer&lt;/b>, but if you want to watch an Edward Norton movie, watch this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Warner - New Line / Region Free<br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br />VC-1 BD-50 / Advanced Profile 3 / AACS<br />Running time: 1:58:53<br />Movie size: 28,71 GB<br />Disc size: 29,37 GB<br />Total bit rate: 32.21 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 27.08 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  1530 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 1530 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 33<br /><br />#3 Deleted Scenes (HD - 6m:54s)<br />#Trailer (HD - 2m:29s)</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'American History X' fails to examine racism in the United States simply because the average person in not a Nazi skinhead.  This movie shows the most extreme side of racism; the side that is so filled with hate that it causes someone to murder.  Although certain moments are powerful and moving, other moments are very ridiculous.<br />The basketball game with the whites vs. blacks is embarassing and so is the scene where Edward Nortan tries to stuff meat down his own sister's throat.  It is manipulative filmmaking; the filmmaker wants to scare the audience with the evil main character.<br />Ed Norton is then thrown in prison for killing two blacks, and then faster than you can say 'Adolf Hitler' in German, he is changed forever.  He is no longer the genocidal skinhead, but is an open-minded good guy who wants to save his brother from the skinhead groups.  All of this happens so abruptly it is unconvincing.  Let me tell you the real reason why Ed Norton's character changed; he did not want to go back to prisom where he would be gang raped.<br />A genuine film about racism would be showing about average people and their racist beliefs.  That is the real racism in America; the subtle stuff that goes on behind closed doors in homes.  Not this.  This show the very extreme of racism and even that is exaggerated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong ! I sincerely think that the subject of AMERICAN HISTORY X is one of the most important matter to discuss nowadays. I cannot stand the arguments of any extremist political or social groups, leftist or  ultra-conservative. But we're here to give an opinion about a movie and not  to have a philosophical meeting about morals. So, in my humble opinion,  AMERICAN HISTORY X is a very poor movie with a great subject and  outstanding actors.<p>The script of AMERICAN HISTORY X is a collection of  clich&eacute;s one can find in thousands of Hollywood movies since the thirties.  Just imagine, in the character played by Edward -DEREK- Norton, James  Cagney or Humphrey Bogart. After having spent three years in jail, Bogie  comes back home and realizes his younger brother has become a potential  public danger. With the help of his parole officer, he'll try to save him  from the streets. Or imagine Gary Cooper, a former hitman, coming back home  only to discover that his son, let's say - Montgomery Clift -, is the  fastest gunman of the town. Will he be able to convince Monty that duels  are a no-future occupation ?<p>Good subjects don't necessarily make good  movies specially if there's only a yes man to direct. So, if you want to  study the evolution of the right-wing neo-nazis groups in today America, it  would be a good idea to see a few documentaries on the subject, and there  are pretty good ones to be seen, rather than to buy AMERICAN HISTORY X.<p>A  pretentious DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>I remember when I was a kid the most I knew of American History X was the curb stomping scene. I didn't know anything more about the movie, so prior to seeing the movie the message was obviously not being translated properly within the minds of my peers. Looking back, though, that was fine by me as I'm mulatto and the friends who introduced the stories of American History X to me were all white, meaning they didn't have any of the personal issues the film mainly referred to.<br /><br />Recently though, I mean within a week of writing this review I have a friend who told me that he would have loved this movie had it not been for the ending (he didn't quite say it that way, but the ending ruined it for him which is the same in my small little mind). I think this is largely due to the editing of the movie putting the focus in an area that kind of throws our reasoning of the movie slightly off.<br />For those of you who may not have seen American History X here's a little break down of the plot: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), an open white supremacist, has been in prison for several years due to the voluntary manslaughter of a couple of black people who tried to carjack him. On the day of his release his brother Danny (Edward Furlong), after turning in an assignment advocating Hitler's Mein Kampf, is required to write a history paper based on Derek's experience.<br /><br />First, I would like to say that this film is brilliant. In its exploration of white supremacy it views all of our stereotyping as a gateway to more virulent hate. Despite it's, at times, extremely violent imagery, X is very much a call for reform in the way that we think of race and of each other as individuals. Many people will, and have, found this movie preachy, but in my opinion it's not as preachy as other race related movies that others have "campaigned" against that I have enjoyed (i.e. Crash).<br /><br />The ending is still quite a point of contention though, and with good reason. As I mentioned before, I think this owes a lot to the editing of this movie. Unfortunately, director Tony Kaye was unable to offer an edit of the movie that the studio was willing to work with, and other editors were brought in and Norton assisted with the editing. The result was an edit of the movie that was extremely Norton heavy, although the finished movie was still thoroughly enjoyable. That also meant the message of the movie was fairly diluted.<br /><br />Viewing the movie from my perspective, though, the story was actually speaking to everyone trying to reform Danny through Derek's story. Sure partially to the movie's detriment the story is overly focused on Derek, but Danny is our way into the story of the movie and he also represents the audience. He's exploring the story of his brother, as we are, because he needs to learn something from it. The whole reason for that exploration: to turn back before it's too late.<br /><br />It's easy to miss that point in the wake of the ending, but if you allow yourself to bypass the end, you'd realize that it really represents the seemingly never ending circulation of hate. Trying not to give away the ending, this is really what we see. Danny has given in to the story of Derek and has freed himself of the hate that once consumed him, but he passed it on to another person who willingly partakes of that hate. It's a cycle that we need to break, and that's really what the ending, including the ending Abraham Lincoln quote signifies.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. I know some people will find it contrived, and a little too on the nose, but I feel there is quite a bit of drama to offset the preachiness of this film. The only other issue that I had with this particular film concerns a score that over emphasizes moments of the movie as grandiose or too foreboding considering the more documentary like style of the shoot. Overall, though, I think it effectively evokes emotion while conveying a message to end the cycle of hate.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />For more review check out: &lt;...></p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This is generally a very good movie which explores the issue of race relations, primarily revolving around the story of a neo-Nazi group in California.  The acting is good overall, the plot is gripping, many of the images are (appropriately) horrifying, and Ed Norton is impressively buff.<br /><br />The main point the movie illustrates is that, because reality is rich and complex, one can readily sift and bend the evidence in order to construct all sorts of ideologies, including generally racist and specifically neo-Nazi ideologies.  A person with a lot of brainpower, but lacking checks and balances, can do this fairly creatively and rigorously, and such a person possessed with rhetorical skill can sell the ideology to more credulous people, especially if they're at an impressionable age or if they're facing tough times and would like to shift blame away from themselves and toward others.  If you have any doubt about this, try the experiment of spending a few days forcefully arguing for an ideology which you abhor; you might be surprised by the extent to which you begin to convince even yourself!  A related point is that falling in the grip of an ideology fosters a tribal mindset, which can lead to conflict between cultures, nations, classes, religious groups, political parties, "special interests," clans, gangs, and of course races (though race is more a cultural than biological concept).  Such conflict can escalate to perpetuated violence ("An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind" - Gandhi).  Again, all of this is illustrated well by the movie.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the movie doesn't really show how the main neo-Nazi character breaks free of his ideology and, moreover, his younger brother breaks free almost literally overnight, which strikes me as fairly implausible.  Because of this flaw, and because the movie didn't really cover any new ground or offer new perspectives for me (I've thought about this stuff for nearly all of my life), I've deducted one star, but I can still recommend this movie to anyone interested in a vivid depiction of these issues.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>American History X is one of the most powerful and gripping dramas ever made. The story shows the tragedy of hate and ignorance on both sides of the black/white racial boundary. Narrated posthumously by Daniel Vinyard, the story shows us the hate of white supremicist Derrick Vinyard and how his hate rips not only his world, but his family apart as well. The movie does an excellent job of driving home the old adage that "what goes around, comes around." With an amazing cast, and powerful story line, it's all but impossible to walk away from this movie unmoved and with eyes unopened</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Tony Kaye<br />Cast:  Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Fairuza Balk, Beverly D'Angelo, Stacy Keach, Jennifer Lien.<br />Running Time:  118 minutes.<br />Rated R for some extreme violence, harsh language, and sexual situations.<p>There are certain films that come out that raise enough commotion due to a political ("Schindler's List"), religous (can anyone say "The Passion of the Christ"?), and historical themes that are sensitive issues for many people.  Many of these films reveal to be an honest portrayal of the account in which they are trying to explain.  "American History X" focuses on the horrors that the root of racism can breed, spreading aimlessly throughout a small California town, and sucking in innocent young adults into a world of fascist and prejudice living.<p>Edward Norton gives the best performance of his young career as a skinead Neo-Nazi who returns from prison to his Venice beach home.  His evolution from a young, bright jock in high school to a thug full of hatred is a rigid, cunning depiction--but the film mainly focuses on his metamorphesis into an enlightened parolee and his relationship with a young brother (played exceptionally well by Edward Furlong, star of "The Terminator 2: Judgement Day") who is following in his toxic foosteps.  Director Tony Kaye's vision of how racism ravages a middle-class family is staggering until the last few moments of the motion picture, taking the audience through a whirlwind of events that will shock, disturb, and expose the true nature of hate--and also the strength and courage that it takes to break the chain.<p>Truly one of the most important films of the last decade, "American History X" is a bold statement that is not for all--adults and children alike; however, it sends a message and tells a story that should be embraced by all people and is articulate enough with its delivery to create a monsoon of emotion.  One of the best films of the latter part of the decade.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) loses his father Dennis (William Russ), who is a firefighter , that died putting out a firefighter in a crack house. Ever since then, Derek has been filled with hate, rage, violence, and racism. He joins up with Cameron Alexander ( Stacey Keach) who is the leader of the Nazi movement in Los Angeles. One night Derek catches three African American men breaking into his car, and he kills them. Derek is sent to prison for six years. While inside, Derek reluctantly becomes friends with an African American prisoner named Lamont (Guy Torry). Over time, Lamont causes Derek to realize that all his hate and anger never made his life any better. Now he is out and a changed man. Unfortunately , his brother Danny ( Edward Furlong) is headed in the exact same direction Derek was, and loves the life of a Nazi. Now it is up to Derek to save his brother and teach him the true meaning of redemption. <p>"American History X" is one of the best films that I have ever seen. The story is amazing, all the actors are outstanding, and the script provides for shocking scenes and great dialogue overall. The film takes an extremely controversial look at racism and shows just how damaging it can be. Watching the film unfold will leave you in awe. The parts dealing with Derek's past are shot in black and white to give them more of an ominous appeal. The present is shot in color to give the appearance of hope. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard. He plays both sides of the character great. He is very convincing as a skinhead, and after prison shows that redemption is possible. Edward Furlong in my opinion did the best job in the movie. Furlong supplies extremely realistic emotion to let the audience know the inner conflict that his character is dealing with. The reason the character has such an impact on the film is because he is only trying to be like his brother. The rest of the cast was filled with excellent actors that include Stacey Keach, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Beverly De Angelo, and Fairuza Balk.<p>"American History X" is a highly controversial and disturbing film. It has shocking scenes and a realistic look at racism. But the story and characters are emotionally driven, and Derek's fight towards retribution is inspriring! It is an entertaining film, but an important one as well. A truly memorable classic.</p></br></body></html>
