But this Scarface film is the most popular. Great movie. It's about how Tony Mantana, ScarFace becomes from a poor politicul pirsoner,to a rich popwerful Mofia boss, to his death. I really like how it's about the rise and fall of a man. Great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>I watched Scarface a long time ago,and considered it to be one of the classics of cinema, a film of sheer raw power, unrelenting in its brutality, with no redemption to any of the characters involved in this dangerous drugs game.<br />Then, few years have passed before I watched it again. Now, more mature and with hundreds of movies later, I did see some flaws and made few observations which I would like to share it with you.<br />It is still a wonderfully made, or shall I say remade movie, and Al Pacino's performance, although somewhat over the top in places, is a powerhouse of 'method' acting. Many of his lines in Scarface have entered history, and his portrayal of Cuban Refugee Tony Montana, with all the successes, excesses and failures, is mind blowing. Yet the film has not aged very well.<br />It is first and foremost a child of its time,the eighties, despite the fact that Scarface is a remade of Howard Hawks original.<br />Another observation, revolves around the film's violence. Scripted by none other than Mr Oliver Stone who shocked audiences later with his own Natural Born Killers, there is too much graphic violence, and so much blood to make even Dario Argento squirm. True,this violence reflects the brutal and very dangerous world of drug trafficking, however,the power of suggestion and psychological violence ala Don Siegel, could have worked equally well in balanced propotions.<br />My universal one million dollar movie question has always been why on earth censors allow so much gore and blood and F words, yet cry murder at any sign of equally graphic nudity and invent new classification for it (NC17).<br />The last observation I would like to make, revolves around the final scene. I believe that scene, although very powerful and memorable, as many would consider it an all time classic, was hastily filmed. The failure of the an assasination attempt in the morning,because Montana got a soft spot for the family in the car of the target,he gets a threatening 'I will show you you so and so' type of call in the afternoon from the Latin drug lord Suza, and few hours later, hundreds of gun totting latinos storm the not so well protected mansion to kill Montana.My first thought was, where did all these guys come from?? Where is the security that the paranoid Montana insisted on and paid so much for? I would imagine a guy like him would have literaly an whole army!!<br />The always excellent M-E Mastrantoni last scene is over the top, and Montana talking to his dead sister in a shocked and drugged insanity is too sentimental, given the development and pace of this last scene.<br />All supporting actors are great, from Mastrantonio, to Steven Bauer, to the highly underrated Robert Loggia, and of course the then unknown Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her earliest roles.<br />Now finally few words about Brian De Palma. I have truly mixed feelings about De Palma.On one hand, he can be considered as a Hitchcok wannabe with films like Body Double, Sisters, Obsession and Dressed To Kill, and on the other as an original film maker with gems like the underrated cult classic Phantom of Paradise, Mission Impossible and Carrie.<br />With Scarface, although a remade and not original film as stated above, you can clearly see his and Stone's prints all over it.<br />So notwithstanding my observations about Scarface, it is still a very good entertaining film, and this is what is important after all. You can suspend belief and excuse the flaws in it, but if you are still entertained by genuis performances and able direction then it certainly should be in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>The Hour is later than anybody thinks, amigo mio, and Tony Montana stands alone.<br /><br />He is besieged in the black-marble-and-gilt inner sanctum of his rapidly crumbling drug empire, and if you take a look-see over his shoulder at the roughly two-bazillion video security monitors you can see what appears to be the entire population of Bolivia doing the 5-minute-mile through Montana's living room---well, anyway, things don't look so good.<br /><br />But whatever. There stands Tony Montana (Al Pacino, sinking entirely into the skin of what is without a doubt one of the biggest bada**es of movie history), snarling defiance, all enraged animal aggression, snorting a few million bucks of his own Bolivian white and ready to go to war, armed for bear with a fully locked-and-loaded streetsweeper, complete with grenade launcher!<br /><br />And seeing as he has a few unexpected late-night visitors, he's way into Introduction Mode.You know, inviting his gate-crashers to say hello to his Little Friend, and all.<br /><br />You know, the Little Friend with the handy-dandy grenade-clip accessory, for those Close Encounters.<br /><br />How did it all come down to this? How did Montana's burning desire for his own little steaming slice of the American Dream get so, well, messy?<br /><br />Whatever the case, be warned: "Scarface" attained its cinematic infamy largely because of two unforgettable scenes that just drip with insanity.<br /><br />Boiled down to its guts, "Scarface" is a flick anchored at one end by a chainsaw in the shower and a heavy-machinegun and a mountain of coke on the other. In the middle we'v got a big, long, endless desert of stylish but lethargic white noise in the middle. And at the end of the day, puzzlingly, "Scarface" is a major downer.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I love "Scarface", relish it, probably for all the wrong reasons. I went so far as to get the Deluxe Super-Duper Special Edition all packaged up in a fake gator-skin case with a lining of red velvet, making you want to do a double-take to make sure you didn't leave the silencer attachment to the 9MM FN Browning rolling around inside the box.<br /><br />So now that we've got my "Scarface" street creds out of the way, let's just face up to facts: Brian De Palma's druglord epic sprawls, sweats ambition, has a lot of really cool "chit" going for it.<br /><br />It has great, supple acting: Pacino chews up every inch of the landscape as Montana, exuding this raw, furious energy, and bloodlust and drive and this curious, weird, endearing integrity---or maybe even naivete---that helps him ascend, muy rapido, into the counsels of first one drug kingpin (Robert Loggia, playing it down a notch) and then another (the great Paul Shennar, playing it like Ricardo Montalban with a straight-razor tucked up one of his Cerruti-clad wrists).<br /><br />A very young Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira Hancock) is all withering barbs, sultry-bored looks, and coked-up emaciated allure; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina, Tony's sister and one of the many objects of his jealous, crazed attention) is perky and all, but for some reason gives me the creeps---ditto for Wayne Doba (formerly the monster in Tobe Hooper's "Funhouse") as the weird-as-batsh*t Octavio the Clown. Yech. Was anyone else besides me relieved when that weird, fat little b*stard took a dirt nap?<br /><br />Steven Bauer as Manny is completely believable, and completely doomed. And F. Murray Abraham might very well have opened up one of the final Seals to Armaggedon by merely appearing in this flick as whiney gangster Omar Suarez, tempting ridicule and the Last Days by baring his sparse chest-hair in one of those seventies disco-fever-number silk shirts. Blech. Seeing him doing a hangman's tapdance from a hovering jet ranger was goofy cool.<br /><br />So is "Scarface" a great movie, one for the ages, worthy of all its hip-hop street creds and gangsta aplomb? I guess it goes two ways: it's a classic for me, and I love it in spite of all its warts. But it does have warts.<br /><br />Now: "Scarface"has those two unforgettable scenes, a character I can truly dig, a surface theme I happen to agree with (you have to carve out your own destiny in blood, sweat, toil and tears), and a generous slathering of cheesy cool---but I think I know why, ultimately the flick rubs me the wrong way.<br /><br />I think Brian De Palma wanted to make a morality play about how having it all, having all the money in the world, really being able to wallow in the truth of "The World is Yours"---well, Esse, at the end of the day it ain't all that. He tries to do with Tony Montana---who I want to see win, and so do you, stop lying---what Oliver Stone did with Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street".<br /><br />That's why "Scarface" feels off, somehow: the flick zags when, dammit, you want it to zig. It's right, it makes sense, that Montana would whack Castro's toady Rebenga and then brag to Loggia about it being fun; it's right that Montana takes a no bullsh*t approach and drives his way right into druglord Alejandro Sosa's heart of darkness.<br /><br />It's right, it's in character, that Montana, in the grip of utter contempt, puts down his former mentor Frank Lopez (Loggia) like a sick, fat, egg-s*cking dog.<br /><br />But come on: would the Montana we know and love every really agonize over sending a couple of squawling brats, ultimately executing the assassin with extreme prejudice and sealing his own fate? Would he really take lip from his mealy-mouthed, money-laundering banker, or would he introduce the interfering little c*bron to his Little Friend? Would he really get all henpecked by Elvira, finally dissolving into a puddle of drug-addled futility? Would he really blast long-time amigo Manny for getting jiggy with Gina?<br /><br />Of course not. But it's a morality tale: what profit it a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?, and all.<br /><br />So yeah, we've got a big bottle of Crystal, but the grapes are rotten; we've got a silver tin of caviar, but it's been out in the sun for a week; we've got a Rolls Royce Phantom with a V4 engine. So Tony Montana slouches down into the bubbles of his marble soaking tub, snapping at Manny and Elvira and pretty much anyone who comes into periscope range, with that livid look snarls "is that all there is?"<br /><br />Or maybe I'm reading too much into it. Maybe the real lesson of "Scarface" is this: if you're gonna doublecross a brutal Bolivian drug-lord and his army of whacked-out M16 wielding zombies, you'd better spend a little of that fortune hiring some muscle besides Chi-Chi and Nick the Pig.<br /><br />Or maybe it's more like this: what profit it a man to gain the whole world if he doesn't have any damned fun afterwards?<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>This movie is talked about by alot of rappers, because they think their cool trying be tough and some actually think Al is cuban.  In truth this movie is not about who is the baddest, who does the most drugs, and kills the most people, this is a real movie a crime drama directed by a good director.  Its got one hell of a performance by Al, who by the way is Italian, and nobody else can deliver the line "say hello to my little friend" like he can.  Its got some good gangster action, the chainsaw scene and the last shootout.  Its got a good story, its got drama, its got some humor, and some pretty good cinematography like in the riot.  Overall is a very good movie, not one of the best, but its definetly an entertaining experience, i give it a 9 out of a 10.  I would just like to say that rap is terrible and soon i hope it will be gone it is ruining the music industry, and anyone who only likes this movie because rappers think its the hot good needs to be shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; has grown into the realm of cult status since it's original release, it is one of those films which was not a blockbuster smash upon release, instead it's value and importance was determined with the passage of time. This is the case with many great films, while &quot;Titanic&quot; isn't talked about as much as when it first came out and broke records, &quot;Scarface&quot; is always a popular favorite and is always cited as an influence on the popular culture. The story is the criminal angle of the American dream: Tony Montana (Al Pacino) arrives on Miami's shores with the large wave of Cuban immigrants who arrived in the early 80's, soon he makes contact in the world of the cocaine trade and rises in it's ranks, ending-up taking over his boss' organization (and mistress played by Michelle Pfeiffer), but the world of lavish excess is also the instrument of his downfall. &quot;Scarface&quot; remains a stylish, vibrant movie, it is one of those few crime pictures where the set design and story work side by side. The screenplay is by Oliver Stone, who himself was living in the world of cocaine-snorting in Hollywood and wrote the script as a goodbye to the vice, is fascinating in it's exploration of the criminal underworld and at the same time tells a highly entertaining, well-crafted story of a man's desire to find success and his downfall brought by the excesses of that success. Director Brian DePalma films the movie with energy and craft, with vibrant colors and a pacing that makes the movie long, but not slow. Al Pacino delivers one of his great performances, he is always on the edge, intense and incredibly convincing. Some have accused the performance of being over-the top, but that's where these characters live. The movie was also first attacked for it's violence, and today some still consider it pretty heavy, but the violence the movie portrays is real. Anyone who watches the news or keeps themselves informed knows the violence in this movie is an everyday reality in the world of the drug trade. In the years since the movie first premiered, &quot;Scarface&quot; has proven to be highly influential, the new DVD edition features a fascinating documentary on the movie's influence on the hip-hop culture who apparently uses this movie as base for ethics and style. For movie buffs it's a great story that's well-made and expertly performed and written, just look at the great ending! &quot;Scarface&quot; is a bonafide American classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>There is no denying that Brian DePalma's Scarface is well designed.  Consider the pivotal nightclub sequence, where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is shaken down by a crooked cop, covets his boss's girlfriend, displays an unhealthy jealousy of his sister's flirtations with a flashy lowlife, and then is almost assassinated by a couple of guys with machine guns - all in the space of a few minutes.  Oliver Stone's screenplay tosses all of these elements into the air like brightly colored rubber balls.  DePalma juggles them deftly with his ever-mobile camera.  The actors help make it all gel by turning in solid performances.  Yet, there are things subtly wrong with it - from the nightclub comedian (Richard Belzer) not quite making sense with his monologue, to the extras all looking like they're watching different shows - their reactions wildly differing in tone and timing.<p>If all this seems like nitpicking, check out a scene from any film by Kubrick or Kurosawa.  It will almost certainly hold up to greater scrutiny.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, I like Scarface quite a bit.  It is a good example of slick, modern cinematic storytelling, with a lot of character development happening visually (if, at times, a bit awkwardly - like the "jealousy" stuff: a tight close up Al Pacino's eyes as he looks at his sister, while Giorgio Moroder makes weird noises on the soundtrack.  Uh, right).<p>The new documentary on the making of Scarface is nicely made, with a lot of revealing interview material with DePalma himself.  If you listen closely, he even obliquely calls himself a "great director".  That's forgivable - a huge ego is a definite asset for an auteur.  <p>Less forgivable is the dismal film transfer, with its milked out blacks, obvious compression artifacts, lack of detail, visible grain, and plain old letterboxed (rather than anamorphic) widescreen.  It seems almost inconceivable that Universal would foot the expense for decent supplemental material, then stick us with what looks like a badly compressed analog telecine transfer from the 80's.  <p>Whatever you think of Scarface, it is one of the most influential films of the past 20 years.  It deserved better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>I've had a lot of recent HD, Blu-ray version letdowns and this is certainly one of them, I won't review the movie because I assume any would be buyer is already a fan, but you should check this out since it does come with the old B&W classic original. Basically many of the scenes simply look BLURRY and out of focus, it's unavoidably noticeable and made me CRINGE in agony upon seeing such scenes in the movie. To me this is an overall letdown and I don't know if they can put out a better version... maybe it's just the nature of the source material that cannot be enhanced without also enhancing original problems with those certain camera shots?</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Yeah, right, I don't believe it.  Almost everyone has seen this movie.  If for some strange reason you haven't, well there are 700 some odd reviews to read here that I'm sure go into great detail about the plot, so read theirs.  I'm just here to tell you that Pacino's performance is one of the best committed to cinema ever.  This film could have easily been just another drug and gangsters movie had it not been Pacino in the lead roll.  His portrayal of Tony Montana is electrifying.  The supporting actors are fantastic in their own right, but Pacino is the reason to watch this remake.<br /><br />I saw this movie opening day in New York city back in 1983 and the entire theater cheered during key moments in the film.  It was quite an experience then, and it's still an experience now.  The Platinum Edition is the way to go.  I don't give five stars lightly, as to me five stars means perfect.  I think many reviewers on Amazon give out five stars like they're giving candy to Halloween trick or treaters.  It is very rare a film I would give a five star review, but if any film is worthy of that rating it's Scarface.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>The 5 stars are for the film, 0 for this edition. Universal could easily have redone the sound on the last anniversary edition, but their marketing scheme was to wait a few years and then do it. I'm not being suckered into double dipping.

Spare me.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>SCARFACE is Brian DePalma's and Al Pacino's operatic masterful retelling of Howard Hughes', Howard Hawks' and Paul Muni's definitive 1932 gangster film of the same name. First panned upon its 1983 release, like it's predecessor and namesake SCARFACE has become a part of the American cultural consciousness far beyond itself.<br /><br />Pacino plays Marielito Tony Montana, a small-time stickup artist in Castro's Cuba who becomes a major drug kingpin in 1980s Miami. Pacino's Montana is reminiscent both of Muni's character and of his own portrayal of Michael Corleone. In Montana, Pacino shows us the twisted inner workings of the criminal personality he presented so convincingly as THE GODFATHER.<br /><br />Pacino gives us an intentionally over-the-top performance, using a theatrically "theek" Cuban accent and unremitting obscenities (estimated as one every thirty eight seconds on average) as the foundation stones for Tony Montana. Much of Pacino's characterization depends on black comedy (Tony's beloved bright yellow Cadillac with the tiger stripe interior is ridiculous to the point of screaming laughter, as is his bloodthirsty earnest buffoonery---after killing two men in cold blood he casually offers his third intended victim a job: "Okay! You call me tomorrow!") Pacino's humor hits its high point when he mutters miserably, "I don't trust Mob guys," while lighting a Corona in unconscious flattery of Vito Corleone. Scarface is very intentionally the id of the more calculating Don Michael.<br /><br />DePalma, through scriptwriter Oliver Stone, manages to penetrate to the heart of darkness of the cocaine subculture. Surrounded by metric tons of cocaine, warehouses full of money, and all the trash it can buy, Montana values only three people in the world, his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and his friends Angel and Manolo (Steven Bauer), one of whom he kills himself and two of whom die through his indirect machinations.<br /><br />When Angel dies in a gruesome chainsaw scene as brilliantly conceived and executed as Janet Leigh's shower scene in PSYCHO, a classic of directorial misdirection, Tony's humanity all but dies, and he rampages through Miami's drug underworld, butchering his rival, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), stealing Lopez's vicious, sexy llello-emaciated wife, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), and burying himself alive in a lust of grotesque materialism. For just a moment the world is his.<br /><br />Pacino captures Montana's colorful rise and his robotic downfall perfectly, showing us that Tony Montana is a spiritually dead character.  Although he fights to protect Gina and idolizes her throughout the film, his lifestyle of excess eventually claims her, as unable to grasp the thought of love as opposed to sheer possession, Tony kills Manolo when he discovers them together. (The two had secretly married and planned to surprise Tony).<br /><br />DePalma also uses the tropical motifs of Miami in a subtle way to mark Tony Montana's rise and fall. Starting out as a wisecracking second-story man addicted to Hawaiian shirts and jeans he later graduates to neon technopop polyester leisure suits in pastel colors and then finally to dark black pinstripes. The further he descends into evil the more conservative and less bright he appears.<br /><br />Pacino's Montana ends his depraved existence with his face buried in a mound of cocaine, and firing a grenade rifle at men come to kill him for botching an assassination---ironically, Tony is to die for not killing the children of an important politician. In the end, this flicker of compassion can't redeem him.<br /><br />The Special Edition second disc has some fascinating material comparing and contrasting the two SCARFACEs, and exploring much of the underpinning of this gangster classic. One of the more interesting segments is a hip-hop exploration of the film, which has become a kind of bible for 'gangsta' rappers. To see Tony Montana lauded as "a man of principle," "loyal to his friends" and a man who "has it all" is an incredible expose of the mindset of the rap contributors to the segment, since Tony Montana is none of the above, except in the most meaningless of ways.<br /><br />Although SCARFACE has its uneven moments and Tony's rise is far more fascinating than his inevitable fall, this movie is far better than its initial weak press reviews indicated. SCARFACE is a true classic and time-capsule piece of the Miami drug scene. Once again, Al Pacino is being, not acting onscreen, and the results are nothing short of amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>SCARFACE is more than just a modernized excessively violent and profane updating of the Depression era original.  Al Pacino as Tony Montana speaks volumes about the need for people to connect to reach other, even on the most superficial of levels.  Montana is speaking to his best friend Manuel (Stephen Bauer) and tells him, "Do you know when you've made it? When you make enough money for people to come to you.  The broads, the cars, the coke, they are just symbols of the money."  To a certain extent, Montana repeats the ages old belief that even if money can't buy love, it can rent it.  The renting of love implies that the possession of material objects is done alone, hence Montana's oft repeated refrain: "I don't need nobody."  Those who come to a bad end in this film are usually the same ones who have taken that credo to heart and the audience wastes no tears over their demise, but director Brian DePalma includes two who do come to a bad end not because they embrace that money-oriented philosophy, but because they get too close to those who do.  Both of these are coincidentally enough, the same two who are closest to Tony  Montana, his friend Manuel and his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Each was raised in a glittery age of 'me-first' longings, but both instinctively recognize that true happiness consists in needing others to share a communal life.  For Manuel and for Gina, they reach out across a blood divide that demands that Tony lethally forbid his cronies from forming personal relationships with his family.  The extreme profanity and dozens of well-photographed killings are so stylized that they take on a life of their own and tend to hide the film's moral center, that a life of crime based on the need to possess things rather than on one that requires shared effort is fated to wind up with either getting killed by mafia assassins or by one's best friends.  In either case, SCARFACE makes it clear that in any culture that prizes possessions over people, the result is a glitzy death for one or a tragic death for the other.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>The reason to buy this DVD is simple: one of the most influential films of the 20th century has finally been released in a newly restored, pristine transfer.  As an owner of the original DVD release, I can testify that the difference is like night and day.  <p>With every viewing, I come to appreciate Brian DePalma's Scarface more and more.  Although not perfect, there is much more right with this film than wrong.  It helps to compare it with its countless imitations:  where most subsequent crime films rush headlong from one bloody gunfight to the next, Scarface takes its time.  Its languid, gliding camera has a certain elegance in the way it reveals story points without relying on clunky Dick-and-Jane dialog or overwrought MTV pyrotechnics.  A prime example is the infamous scene where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) attemps to buy two kilos of cocaine from some Coloumbians for his boss, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia).  Watch the way the camera drifts from the Miami Beach hotel room, across a peaceful sun-drenched street, over to the car where Tony's associates are waiting for him, then slowly back up to the bathroom window, where the sound of the idling chainsaw grows louder.  Creepy. Insinuating. It's comparable to the best work of Hitchcock - a day-lit nightmare where the ordinary becomes sinister.  Watch closely as the Columbian dismembers Tony's friend limb by limb.  In spite of the scene's reputation, we never actually see what's happening.  Like the shower murder in Psycho, all the violence is implied - so strongly, in fact, that DePalma had to fight the MPAA in a well-publicized battle to keep Scarface from receiving an X rating.<p>It's interesting the way that the improved picture and sound seem to contribute to every aspect of the film.  Subtleties in Pacino's largely unsubtle performance become clear.  We can better see what he does with his face in those famously shadowy close-ups; the way he registers what he's thinking privately, even as he swaggers with exaggerated bravado.  Where once it seemed he was over-acting at times, it is now apparent that he was carefully playing his character's machismo against a darker undercurrent of great hunger - so intense that it defies articulation.  Tony Montana's great tragedy is his utter lack of self-knowlege.  Beneath the clouds of cordite and testosterone, he is so painfully needy that he will draw everyone around him into a decaying orbit of destruction.  He is a criminal, but he is not immoral.  He is a black hole of a man, a vacuous human being whose desires eclipse whatever soul that a life of deprivation and decay may have left him.  He acts without apology, or even much thought.  He's an animal in both the best and worst senses of the word.  The tragedy is not so much that he is killed at the end - he brings that on himself - it is that so many others, not least the addicts that buy his product, must suffer and die as well.  It's downright Shakespearean, but with (lots of) f-words in place of gilded Elizabethan speech.<p>Once you get past those 160-odd f-variants, Oliver Stone's screenplay begins to seem as thoughtful as it is blunt.  The language is harsh, but also truthful, with plenty of quotable lines (though you would not want to quote them in polite company).<p>The improved sound mix also brings into relief something that I had always looked upon as a liability of Scarface - the very "80's" music score, which had always seemed to me the newer equivalent of those ham-handed "jazz" scores from certain 50's melodramas like Man With the Golden Arm.  But now the music seems "dated" more in the way of an early James Bond score; it is appropriate to the era.  Were Scarface made now, it would still be a legitimate choice of styles.<p>The extras are thorough, though the "making of" documentary seems to be a longer version of the one from the original DVD release. There is also a documentary on Scarface's considerable influence on hip-hop music, but I smell  an Obvious Plug for a CD of music "inspired" by the film. (The package insert proclaims that it's In Stores Now! from DefJam records.) <p>In any case, Scarface has finally received its due respect in a form that showcases the late John Alonso's brightly-hued, yet somehow gritty cinematography.  Alonso also photographed the sumptuous Chinatown.  This DVD is also a tribute to him - a master of light and shadow, whose old-fashioned, hard-lit chiaroscuro images contributed in no small way to Scarface's status as a modern classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Brian De Palma's blood soaked gangster epic is on DVD, once again.  I'll say this right off the bat, if you own the previously released Special Edition of Scarface, there's no reason to run out and buy this Platinum Edition, which has an assortment of previously released extras to go along with a counter for how many times the "F" word is used and how many bullets are fired.  Besides that, there's nothing here that hasn't been seen before, but if you don't already own Scarface on DVD, well then, this is worth picking up.  As for the film itself, it's a bloody crime epic featuring one of Al Pacino's best, and most infamous, performances as Cuban hood turned drug kingpin Tony Montana; but chances are, you already know all that.  The DVD's picture quality looks cleaner, and the "remastered and remixed" sound is crisper as well, but whether or not you want to lay down the cash for this depends on how many times you've been suckered into buying the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>Since it's release in 1983, Brian De Palma's "Scarface" has become of the definitive cult classics of American movies, it's excesses have so imprinted themselves into popular culture that it's influence can be found in everything from clothing to popular lingo ("say hello to my little friend!") to rap music and rap videos. And yet, this is not a poorly executed movie, this is a brilliantly excessive crime drama filled with the kind of stylish, gritty quality that made films like "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" equally effective (eventhough "Scarface" probably still stands as the bloodiest, edgiest film of it's kind). The screenplay was written by Oliver Stone before he became a visceral, provocative director and during the period when he was letting go of that notorious vice known as cocaine, he hung around with real Colombian gangsters and there is a unique authenticity to the film in it's violence and scenarios that helps it paint a portrait of the darker side of the American dream. Al Pacino is merciless and unforgettable as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant arriving on Miami's shores and ready to make big bucks and finds his answer with the world of drug trafficking. Watching the film, it is no wonder why Tony Montana has become such a potent figure in popular movie culture, he is a great character, so alluring in his perversity that the word "villain" seems too cartoonish for him. His accent is catchy and his clothes cool and colorful (Stone recently commented on how Montana's style in dress and jewelry can be seen reflected in African-American culture). The film is famous for it's scenes of violence, including a victim chained to a shower and killed with a chainsaw. Director Brian DePalma, not really known for excess gloriously lavishes in it here and films his movie with style and gusto, "Scarface" is unique because it feels like it was made with real respect for the material. Consider that you have one of Hollywood's future greatest directors writing the script and one of American film's most stylish talents directing and on top of that, an iconic actor in the lead role. Even the moody main theme is composed by none other than Giorgio Moroder. The ending is especially deliciously bloody, as if a normal shoot-out is for sissies. "Scarface" remains a potent movie because it has themes we can all relate to, we all want wealth, power and at least one beautiful woman, "Scarface" asks the question of what extremes would one go to to achieve wealth, and is it worth anything when it is dirty money?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Brian De Palma's epic blood soaked remake of the 1932 Paul Muni gangster classic may not have gotten all the critical acclaim in the world, but it stands as a landmark performance of the great Al Pacino.  Pacino brings to the screen one of his most well known characters in his career as Tony Montana; a cuban refugee who rises to power in Miami's cocaine underworld.  Along with him is his best friend Manny (Steve Bauer) and the two begin working for Frank (Robert Loggia), a slimy, manipulative excess driven drug kingpin whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) Tony soon develops an obsession for.  Oliver Stone wrote the script and helped make Tony one of the most unforgettable characters in all of American cinema.  Scarface has since become a cult classic and contains some of the most memorable lines of dialogue in film, not to mention the most rampant use of profanity that would not be topped for years to come.  The only problem I ever had with Scarface was it's length; clocking in at nearly 3 hours, there are times when the film drags, but that is only a minor complaint.  All in all, if you want to see one of Al Pacino's finest performances (aside from Devil's Advocate, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, or anything beginning with the title The Godfather), then consider Scarface essential viewing, but be warned, this is not a film for all tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is one of the greatest of all mob movies. It's an epic crime drama done with style and care. Brian DePalma presents a film that ignites the screen with a great screenplay by Oliver Stone and an  amazing performance by Al Pacino. Unlike &quot;The Godfather,&quot; which  was more about family and relationships between father and son,  &quot;Scarface&quot; is an exhilarating and intriguing journey into Miami's  mob underworld, seen through the eyes of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee with  some of the greatest lines in movie history. The degree of excess here is  brilliantly done and adds even more realism to a great work. DePalma shows  a wonderful touch of style in the sets, costumes, cars, even in the  violence. Look at the brilliant eye for composition he shows in a scene  where an assassination attempt is carried out on Tony in a nigh club. The  movie is full of that Latin style and intensity. The screeenplay By Oliver  Stone is brilliant because it's complex in the way in which we are not just  interested in the action, but characters and events as well. We really care  about what happens with these people, least of all Tony. Pacino gives one  of the greatest and most intense performances, always believable. He steals  the show entirely through his accent and facial expressions. The action  sequences aren't dim-witted, but smart and stylish. &quot;Scarface&quot;  vibrates with style and realism like few gangster dramas have. It stands as  a masterpiece. One of the greatest crime pictures of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>I missed this intentionally when it came out in 1983 believing it to be another version of the Al Capone story.  It is, sort of.  Of course Al Pacino would be brilliant as Al Capone and demand every square inch of the screen and get it.  And he was and he did.  And director Brian DePalma would spray the screen in scarlet, and he did.  However this updated and revised version set in Miami from a script by Oliver Stone is very much worth watching even though it's almost three hours long.<p>First of all, Al Pacino is riveting as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee released from prison by Fidel Castro in 1980 who arrives in Florida with a yearning to rule the world and a huge chip on his shoulder.  His character is an extreme version of the &quot;live fast, die young&quot; species, the kind of guy who takes extreme chances and fears nothing.  It is a shame that it is not obvious that for every one of the Tony Montanas in the world who actually made it to the top of the cocaine pile, there are thousands who weren't able to dodge the bullets and died not just young, but very young.<p>Second, there is not a dead spot in the whole movie.  Stone's action-driven script and DePalma's focused direction compel our attention.  If you can stand the bestial mentality and the animalistic flash culture of the drug lords and their sleazy world, you might even want to see this twice.<p>What I found myself watching closely was Michelle Pfeiffer at twenty-something, strikingly beautiful and totally degenerate as the cocaine-addled moll.  Also very much worth watching was Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony Montana's sister Gina.  The big brother/little sister incestuous theme (from the original Scarface of 1931 starring Paul Muni and directed by Howard Hawks) was craftily prepared and reached a striking climax (if you will) in the scene in which Gina tells Montana that he must &quot;have her&quot; (that's not exactly the words she used) since he won't let anybody else have her.  The touch of necrophilia that followed was perhaps gratuitous.<p>What I loved was the way DePalma reminded us again and again of how trapped the characters were by their desperate indulgences, the expensive liquor, the cigars, the cocaine, the stacks of money that took hours to count by machine.  The scene in which Pfeiffer takes a snort of cocaine, a puff of a cigarette and a swallow of booze one after the other as the only thing she knows how to do in this world (with the white powder still on her nostrils) was wonderful in its piteous effect.  I also liked the scene in which Montana, seated in his black leather chair with his initials in gold lettering, surrounded by his security video screens, dives into a pile of cocaine and comes up with it on his nose.  Reminds me of the old doper saying, &quot;Too much is never enough.&quot;<p>The shoot 'em up finale of course was much, much overdone and about as realistic as a John Wayne barroom fight, but I loved the way Pacino played Montana near the end as a kind of paranoid Napoleon, the little guy who wanted to rule the world now finished and insane.  Note, by the way, in how many scenes Pacino played a very vigorous persona sitting down.<p>In the final analysis this is a morality tale, a kind of very flashy &quot;crime does not pay&quot; saga not because the cops will get you (they don't) but because the life itself will corrupt you beyond anything human.  Those who live by the gun will die by the gun, and there is no security among murders and thieves.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Having seen the previous Scarface (starring Paul Muni) many years ago, I was curious to see what director Brian De Palma would do with what I incorrectly assumed to be essentially similar material. In fact, De Palma co-authored a script (with Oliver Stone) and created a film which shares almost nothing in common with its predecessor. Al Pacino is brilliant as Tony Montana, a vicious and impoverished Cuban immigrant who eventually becomes a wealthy drug lord in Miami. Along the way, he eliminates or alienates family members and friends as well as his underworld enemies. Montana's destiny is perhaps summarized by the ancient aphorism "live by the sword....die by the sword." For me, the most memorable scene involves a power saw in the bathroom of an apartment in which a drug deal fails. Others include Tony's sudden acts of violence in response to real or imagined threats to his supremacy ("manhood") and the final sequence when his heavily-guarded mansion is invaded by assassins as he snorts his way through a mound of cocaine on his desk. Steven Bauer is especially effective as Montana's best friend Manny. Other strong performances are provided by Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira), Robert Loggia (Frank Lopez), and F. Murray Abraham (Omar). This is among the nastiest and bloodiest of gangster films. There is a rationale for most of the violence in the Godfather films whereas in this Scarface, Montana's behavior seems instinctive and is therefore more upsetting. (The same is true of the characters played by Joe Pesci in Goodfellas and Casino.) In 1932, director Howard Hawks wanted to portray a fictional character (Tony Clamonte) based on Al Capone without in any sense romanticizing the criminality which the real "Scarface" personified. Decades later, De Palma examines with surgical skill how the American Dream for so many immigrants becomes an American Nightmare for Montana and for almost everyone with whom he is associated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Okay, so I'm stealing a great line from Al Pacino!  But let me tell you something.  This movie goes down as one of my favorite movies of all time.  Not my most favorite, mind you, but definitely up there in the top 10!<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie, back in the mid 80's, I was just at the end of highschool, and had started college.  A couple buddies of mine and my brother went to see Scarface and find out what the fuss was all about!<br /><br />We walked out, awestricken!  What an incredibly emotionally charged experience watching Scarface for the first time.  Seeing Al Pacino on the big screen, playing something other than an Italian-American; bad guy Cuban Mafioso punk!  His curse laden slurring pronunciation of words has influenced many poor imitators including comedian Dana Carvy all the way to Tony Soprano!  The storyline has also branched off several imitators, from videogames to B-Rated Movies, hell, even A-Rated movies.  But nothing compares to the original!<br /><br />Do I need to tell you the story?  Probably not.  Maybe it's more fun to just shout out some great quotes and favorite parts of the film.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /><br />1) "Say hello to my little friend!"  My college-hood buddy always insisted the line was:  "I want you to meet my little friend!" but I always knew the truth.<br /><br />2) "I never f'ed nobody, didn't have it coming to him."<br /><br />3) "In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women."<br /><br />4) Tony Montana: Me, I want what's coming to me.<br />Manny: Oh, well... what's coming to you?<br />Tony Montana: The world, Chico, and everything in it.<br /><br />5) Dat chick he's with - she like me.<br /><br />6) You wanna waste my time? Okay. I call my lawyer. He's the best lawyer in Miami. He's such a good lawyer, that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska. So dress warm.<br /><br />I'm sure you all can think of many more, I'm sure.  All in all, this movie is excellent, and provides a lot of bang for you buck, in a gratuitioutous sort of way!<br /><br />My type of movie.  And on top of all this, directed by Brian De Palma, my favorite all time director.

The result was "Scarface," starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the "Marielitos" who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as "Caracortada."  Scarface.<p>Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up,  Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all.  Wealth and power-- that was Montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia).  Lopez, it seems, had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to Castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in "Little Havana," along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives.  And in short order, Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.<p>Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work.  In his day, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative:  Cocaine.  Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be:  At the "top."  With a cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost.  but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man.  And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.<p>In step with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully.  From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real.  What he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can.  This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him.  It's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.<p>Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom.  As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance.  She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.<p>The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein).  An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed "Traffic," and "Blow," and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch," De Palma's "Scarface," originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga.  Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing.  But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end.  And like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time.  But the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I was born after this movie was made, so watching it is almost like a time-warp when I look at the outfits and the technology they had back then. I am certain that Scarface would have gone along differently if this had all happened thirty years later, with the technology we have now.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a classic movie, though it is not for everyone due to the drugs and violence in it. The reason why I give this movie four instead of five stars is because some things were left unanswered, like what happened to Elvira, but the very last scene with the shootout was pretty fricking epic.</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>This is one of Pacino's classic movies some say it is his best movie ever If you are a Pacino or a gangster/mafia movie  fan this is a absoulute must for you .

If I am correct and this theatrical release is indicative of the Blu-Ray release, I can tell you that the film has never looked more stunning. The picture is crisp, clean, and really shows how beautifully shot the film is, as well as the unique use of color throughout.<br /><br />Scarface needs no introduction. Loosely inspired by a 1932 gangster-picture based on Al Capone, Scarface is a bonafide gangster-movie classic that has overshadowed its 1932 counterpart to the point of obscurity. A teacher I had in high school was once (poorly and inaccurately) discussing movies and asked the class "Scarface is based on a true story, right? Who is it based on?" A kid in the back of the class called out "Al Capone." The teacher laughed and in a mocking tone replied "It's not based on Al Capone!" There you have it; for many people, this is not only the definitive version of Scarface, but the only one that exists. The film developed a cult following after its 1983 theatrical release, but has outgrown that cult following and developed something much more substantial. As of 2011, the film has been widely embraced by mainstream audiences, film critics, filmmakers, and Hip-Hop musicians. It's been endlessly satirized, parodied, and referenced in popular culture and is considered a classic "gangster" picture, frequently mentioned alongside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019L770A">The Godfather</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729725">GoodFellas</a>. It also has one of the most legendary screen performances of all time with Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami, Florida with nothing but his balls and his word...and an insatiable thirst for power.<br /><br />Directed by Brian De Palma at the peak of his creativity and written by Oliver Stone, Scarface appeals to a wide range of demographics due to the collaborative creative genius of these two. De Palma had made a name for himself directing thrillers with strong artistic sensibilities, while Stone had yet to establish himself as he would later and his recent writing projects had been the acclaimed Midnight Express and, oddly enough, Conan the Barbarian. De Palma had a style that appealed greatly to film aficionados, but he also possessed a capacity for making films that were accessible and straight-forward enough for the mainstream, while Stone had dabbled in action films but possessed the intelligence, capability, and talent to do something more than his r&eacute;sum&eacute; suggested. Scarface is a film that has been subjected to long-winded analysis by esteemed film critics and has simply been labeled "badass" by the typical moviegoer. On the surface, it's just a gangster movie with plenty of cocaine, violence, and language but Stone managed to incorporate more complicated themes of lust, power, and determination into his straight-forward narrative. This film and the Tony Montana character represent something to people. His principles and extravagant lifestyle have made him an idol for those maintaining a "gangster" persona, but there's something deeper too. Perhaps it's because Tony essentially lives the drug-addled American Dream that people latch onto him so fiercely.<br /><br />Most people seem to agree that Scarface is a masterpiece, but I've always found it a tad overrated. In recent years, the term `overrated' has grown to mean "something that's supposed to be great, but is actually terrible." When I say Scarface is overrated, I mean that it's supposed to be great, but I've found that it just lingers on that line between `great' and `very good.' There are many scenes that rank as some of the best in cinematic history and so few bad scenes, but I have never latched onto the film in the way so many others have. The more I see it though, the more apparent things become. Most recently, I started to take notice of the score by Giorgio Moroder. It's synthesizer-driven, yet doesn't age the film as many musical scores from the 80s have. Would the opening credits of the film be so effectively ominous with any other music? Much of the music is as iconic as the film and suits the tone and setting perfectly.<br /><br />Many aspects of Scarface lend to the case that it's one of the greatest films ever made. This is one of the most quotable movies ever made certainly and the iconic dialogue (coupled with the delivery) still holds up after becoming so imbedded into the cultural vernacular. Most films are lucky if they have half as many great/memorable scenes as this one; the opening scene, the chainsaw scene, the helicopter scene, the bathtub scene, and, of course, the incredibly executed climax. De Palma's direction is straight-forward enough for mainstream viewers, but has enough of his artistic sensibility to give film enthusiasts something to admire. Then, there's the one-of-a-kind performance by Al Pacino which, make no mistake about it, is one of the great screen performances. As Tony Montana, Pacino is frightening, hilarious, psychotic, yet human, going completely over-the-top but never losing control. Few actors could make Tony such a layered character. It's a calculated performance that is utterly flamboyant and endlessly fascinating. The iconic status of Scarface is indebted to Pacino, who took a great risk playing this character this way and miraculously, flawlessly pulled it off. He's overacting certainly, but how else could this character exist? Even going over-the-top, Tony never seems disconnected from the world around him. Stone's dialogue is great on its own, but Pacino's declaration "All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one" is the landmark dialogue it is because of the way it's delivered rather than written. "I kill a communist for fun, but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice." Calculated; even with the flamboyant accent, Pacino emphasizes every word just right for maximum effect. When Pacino is onscreen, the movie is his. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him and without him, Tony Montana would not exist in the capacity he does today. It's a performance that will still be talked about hundreds of years from now. His performance makes such a massive impression that the other acting contributions are frequently overlooked. While this is unquestionably Pacino's movie in every sense, as he overshadows everyone around him, the actors that inhabit this world do incredible work themselves, evident in how each and every character, big and small, are so memorable. There is not a weak performance to be found and if people could avert their eyes from Pacino for a moment, they'd rave about the ensemble. The cast sink into their characters so well that it's impossible to separate the character from the actor. How many times do you think people have seen Steven Bauer in later films and thought `its Manny!'<br /><br />Scarface is an imperfect film, but this critique may be based on viewer subjectivity rather than cinematic imperfection. Regardless, the perfections largely outnumber the imperfections, which are few but prominent. It's a little too `80s for its own good at times, especially in the obligatory, cheesy 80s montage that singlehandedly ages the movie more than anything else. Even with a running time of 170 minutes, Oliver Stone's script is very tightly structured. Stone even suggests Shakespearean themes amongst the chaos, but some scenes seem stretched too long. Perhaps Stone felt every scene in his script was necessary to illustrate the man Tony Montana is, but it seems that it could have been trimmed and had the same impact. De Palma's direction is near-perfect until it comes to handling Tony's incestuous inclinations towards his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). This is an essential part of illustrating Tony Montana's psyche, but I have issues with the way De Palma handles it. It just seems so over the top and overemphasized. With the final scene between Tony and Gina, it may have been impossible, but I think De Palma could have made it more subtle rather than emphasizing Tony's feelings with ominous music and extreme close-ups.<br /><br />No matter what the subject matter, you need to be in a certain mood and frame of mind to embark on a 3-hour movie. My level of enjoyment watching Scarface has varied with each viewing due to extraneous circumstances. I'm in the minority in that I consider it a mild masterpiece, but wouldn't rank it as one of my favorite films. On this more recent viewing, I grew bored with it at times but this could be attributed more to a lack-of-sleep and a long day than an objective view of the quality of the film. While I enjoyed it less than before, my appreciation for it deepened dramatically and I may retract my steadfast affirmation that it's not a masterpiece when I watch it again someday. I greatly admire it, but I don't greatly enjoy it. In the meantime, I acknowledge that Scarface has lost none of its power with the curse of over-familiarity. Everyone has seen this film referenced or parodied at some point, yet this has not reflected on the finished product at all. Whether people's undying love for the film stems from what it is or what it represents is irrelevant; Scarface, in many ways, is a great film that has made an impact on both cinema and culture that can't be ignored.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>While I own the 2 disc Standard Def set that came out a few years ago, I thought I would buy this Blu Ray edition without the Digital Copy.  Very glad to have made the purchase.<br /><br />In past version I often wondered why it appeared so blanched out, especially in the early scenes as Tony Montana, Manny, Angel and a friend were going to do the deal with the Columbians.  The new Blu Ray edition brings back all the color and vitality to the original image and stays vital though out the film.  The Blu Ray version truly has provided a significant improvement over previous Scarface releases.  It's not perfect, there is some grain here and there, easy to see in the sky shots and when the cement walls are in the shots.  However, this grain is not exceedingly so and does not distract, nor is it there in most of the film.  At the end of the movie, as Tony and associates bring Gina back to his mansion after Tony kills Manny, there is a wide shot of the red carpeted staircase.  I did notice some aliasing at the bottom of the staircase, but as the camera zooms in, it goes away.  Red has always been a very difficult color to reproduce which is why it is rarely used in credits as it can cause stair-stepping and aliasing, however, this was the only instance where I saw any and it last but a few seconds.<br />The blu ray transfer is really very, very good.<br /><br />The two disc Standard Def version used DTS 5.1 audio while the Blu Ray provides 7.1 DTSHD audio.  The score is spread very nicely though out the entire speaker system,(mine is 5.1) however, there really is very little use of any of the channels for discreet directionality making the 7.1 possibilities only useful for the music score itself.  Audio always seems to get the short end of the financial straw in film releases and transfers, and Scarface is no different.  There were plenty of opportunities for surround foley fx in the riot at the holding camp as well as the final mansion shootout.  Sides and rears are sometimes used for slight panning of the vehicles and not much more.  The dialogue is clear and properly leveled so once you set your volume you should not have to reset at any time.<br /><br />The video transfer and movie gets 5 stars from me, while the audio gets 3.<br />Hopefully, this review has been helpful, and if so, click on that help button so I know I am on the right track.</p></br><a href="../users/AYUFQY3XG4ZBR.html">AYUFQY3XG4ZBR</a><br/><p>Al Pacino was without a doubt a well-respected actor who had &quot;made his bones&quot; with any number of defining roles prior to his portrayal of Tony Montana in this Brian DePalma remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks &quot;Scarface&quot; based loosely on the life of Al Capone.  And in truth he's done some terrific work since, as well (&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, to name a few).<p>But this movie, thanks mainly to Pacino's merciless performance, has done more for pop culture than anything else he's ever been associated with.  That crazy over-the-top Marielito accent has been (badly) imitated more often among a generation of movie fans who weren't even out of diapers when &quot;Scarface&quot; was released back in 1983 than Marlon Brando's cotton-cheeked Don Corleone was mimicked since he came onto the scene in 1972; &quot;SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND&quot; has become the &quot;YOU TALKIN' TO ME?&quot; of the closing stages of the 20th Century.<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; practically invented the culture behind the hip-hop lifestyle, and this is brilliantly conveyed in the Def Jam featurette &quot;Origin of a Gangsta&quot; included on the second disc of this two-disc set, one of the most unique (and well-placed) special features ever to be included with a feature presentation; a director's commentary audio track would probably have been better appreciated, but the documentary footage included on the second disc mostly makes up for it.<p>The movie itself never looked better.  I never saw the previous DVD format, so I can't make a comparison, but it absolutely blows my old VHS tapes out of the water.  The 2.35:1 widescreen ratio is fantastic and all of Miami in its cocaine-addled '80's glory shines off the TV screen like a great big p****, just waitin' to get f*****...but I digress.  The sound is fantastic, and just when you think the movie has been dragging for too long, the last fifteen minutes exhilerates you to the point where you're ready to watch the whole thing all over again.<p>If this gangster movie isn't in a class by itself, it won't take long to call the roll.  If you EVER suspected that you might like gangster movies but want a different take on the genre than the NYC goombah angle, this is the flick for you.  And if you're a fan of Al Pacino...well, chances are you've already seen it at least five times...so what are you waiting for?  Buy it at once!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>In 1983, I was 18 and remember being blown away by Brian DePalma's gangster epic Scarface, Twenty years later I'm not so sure what the fuss was about. The story is familiar to just about everyone. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) comes to America as part of the Cuban boat lift with literally nothing. He kills a Communist in Feedom City and becomes friends with Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) Miami's leading cocaine dealer. The film arc at this point follows the story line of the 1932 Howard Hawks film of the same title and Montana rises to be a powerful drug lord. Eventually getting in trouble because of his own need to achieve he is then brutally murdered by the Columbian cartel. Limited support for Pacino's over the top portrayal comes from best fiend Manny (Stephen Bauer) and a very young Michelle Pieffer who plays love interest Elvira.<p>The 20th Anniversary Edition presents the film in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The picture looks great thanks to the late John A. Alonzo's cinematography but I felt that the sound left a little to be desired.<p>The performances have become legendary and Pacino carries the film with his completely over the top portrayal. Supporting players do little more than allow him to show off his acting ability.<p>Is this grat cinema? After 20 years reflection, my answer would be no but it is a good genre film. The problem is that when this movie came out it was completely innovative in terms of violence and language. Today, we have simply seen this before. The 2:50 length also detracts. There are places in the film where it seems to crawl. Overall, the film is good but it simply is not what I remembered from twenty years ago. Perhaps I'm just getting old.<p>The special features comprise an entire disc but offer nothing spectacular. The best  feature is a series of making of type documentaries hosted by producer Martin Bregman with interviews with Oliver Stone, Pacino, Bauer, and film composer Georgio Morodor. This feature discusses the film from its origins to actual filming and ratiting difficulties. There is also  a television edits reel that is more funny than enlightening. A twenty minute deleted scenes feature offers little since there is no context in which to view these scenes and no director commentary.<p>Def Jam has added a feature explaining why the film has become a Hip Hop classic and features many performer interviews. This feature is interesting and offers a look inside the rap industry.<p>Overall this would be a good rental if you're not an absolute fan. A piece of cultural history maybe but not what I remembered.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>In this remake of the 1932 film of the same name, we witness the rise of a small time Cuban refugee hoodlum, as he guns his way to the top of Miami's cocaine empire. Tony Montana's chase after the American Dream gave him wealth, power, and passion beyond his wildest dreams. But we are also witness to the man's downfall, as he becomes more and more addicted to drugs, and ruled by paranoia and jealousy. However, Tony Montana would go down as one of the most ruthless gangsters that ever lived, and be known to the world only as Scarface. <p>Al Pacino has made a lot of memorable films, but he has never acted with such intensity or ruthlessness as he did with Tony "Scarface" Montana. His performance alone is worth the price of the DVD. "Say hello to my little friend!" Michelle Pfeiffer looks great no matter what role she plays. She assumes the role of Pacino's love interest Elvira Hancock. The performance she gives is so great, because she was the first female lead in an film like Scarface, to ever talk back and not take anything from anyone. Her strong will actually challenges Tony, which brings out the best in the character. Steven Bauer was excellent as Tony's best friend and partner Manny. The friendship between him and Pacino is extremely well done, and it is great to watch them get to the top together. Bauer is also down right hillarious with his views on women. The funniest scene in the film is when he attempts to pick up a woman by wiggling his tongue at her, and then he gets slapped. "Lesbian!" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Robert Loggia, and F Murray Abraham are all sensational in their roles as well. <p>But the film is not only great for the overall story and acting, but for the screenplay as well. The intense screenplay was written by Oliver Stone, and gives superb insights into Miami's latin lifestyle, as well as great dialogue to the characters, and tons of unforgettable firepower. The costume and set designs are spectacular. The musical score is haunting and drives the film. It is used especially well when you see Pacino's face. The score helps to intensify Pacino's character as a whole. Finally, the cinematography is outstanding in this film as well as the camera work. Each shot is used to perfection to capture every character reaction, and every aspect of violence. <p>The DVD is truly the only way to see the film for two reasons. For one thing the VHS version is 2 casettes, and nothing is worse than having to get up and change tapes when you are caught up in the story. The second is that the extras are outstanding. The original DVD release of Scarface was out of print for a long time, and now it is finally being re-released under the "Anniversary Edition". You get 85 minutes of behind the scenes footage, as well as 22 minutes worth of deleted scenes. The DVD is worth the money just for the film itself, but now you have an extra incentive to buy. Not many movies are a must own in my opinion, but this one definately is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Given the high-power talent behind the camera (Brian DePalma), in front of it (Al Pacino), and at the typewriter (Oliver Stone), SCARFACE should have quite a lot going for it.  It does indeed, although I can't quite call this a GODFATHER-type masterpiece for certain reasons.<p>Ostensibly, this is a reworking of Howard Hawks' classic 1932 gangster pic about Al Capone.  This time, the setting is Miami circa 1980, the contraband in question is cocaine, and the lead character, Pacino's Tony Montana, is a Cuban-born criminal who just came off the Mariel boat lift with 125,000 others that Castro let go, twenty percent of whom were known criminals.  Pacino gets in on the ground floor with a local drug boss (Robert Loggia) and soon works his way to the top, doing just about everything to tick someone off--associates, enemies, cops, his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer), his sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), and the Colombian drug kingpins he has to do business with.<p>But in his cocaine-fueled journey to achieve the so-called American Dream, he neglects to follow two rules taught to him by Loggia: (1) Don't underestimate the other guy's greed; and (2) Don't get high on your own supply.  He finally crosses the line in the end by alienating a Colombian drug boss (Paul Shenar) so much that Shenar sends assassins to Pacino's Miami villa.  The result is a horrific and bloody shootout in which most of the assassins are rubbed out, and so is Pacino.<p>Without a doubt, SCARFACE continues to generate wildly divergent opinions, both pro and con.  I for one had some trouble trying to stomach Pacino's Cuban accent at first, but then his ultra-charistmatic performance kicked into high gear, four-letter words and all.  The film is very true to its essentials of showing how a certain segment of the Cuban boat people, a very SMALL segment, tried to latch onto the American Dream by trafficking in illegal narcotics and thus earning millions.  Probably the most interesting thing about SCARFACE is the political view that Stone espouses in his screenplay: he seems to espouse a very Reaganesque view of the world of the 1980s (virulent anti-Communism; anti-Castro), but in truth he is severely critical of those very same policies that motivated Castro to send the worst of his worst onto American soil and thus accelerate this nation's drug problem.<p>SCARFACE does have its faults.  It requires a lot of patience to sit through with a running time approaching 170 minutes, and I am not all that sure there is enough in there to sustain it for that kind of length.  The film continues to be controversial in some quarters for its extreme (as opposed to merely excessive) violence; the chainsaw scene in an apartment, the hanging from a helicopter, and the ultra-gory shootout at the end rank as some of the most violent scenes ever shown on film.  Only four other films in history challenge it in this respect: THE WILD BUNCH, SOLDIER BLUE, TAXI DRIVER, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Finally, this film set a record for the greatest number of times the &quot;F&quot; word, or variations of it, are used; I lost count at two hundred.  This IS a bit much, although it probably fits the reality of the situation it depicts.<p>On the other hand, DePalma, whose 1976 film CARRIE remains one of the touchstone suspense/horror films of all times, does make quite a lot out of Stone's wild and crazy screenplay--though surprisingly, for the violent scenes, he doesn't use slow-motion or montage that much, which would have earned him favorable comparisons with the legendary Sam Peckinpah.  Just as solid is the camera work of John Alonzo, who worked on CHINATOWN and BLACK SUNDAY, among others.  Giorgio Moroder's score is pretty good, though I do admit it gets a little cheesy after a while.  And Pacino's performance is also high-caliber; just get used to his Cuban accent, and it works very well.<p>This film comes highly recommended, but with this warning: It is definitely NOT for younger audiences, it is rated 'R' for a lot of good reasons.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>&quot;Me?  I want what's coming to me...  The world, Chico--and everything in it.&quot; - Tony Montana<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; was a box-office flop when it first came out and was literally trashed by almost every film critic that you can think of.  Many years later, it's considered a classic and some say it's one of the most influential gangster movies to ever to be made.  There's real power that cannot be denied that is held within this amazing masterpiece that has one of the highest replay values I've ever experienced.  I can NEVER get tired of this outstanding gangster epic, and it is a grand event that stands out from most crime sagas--and most films althogether.<p>Tony Montana came to America with nothing, with the exception of a dream to become a somebody; a successful and powerful somebody.  He turns to a life of crime and slowly but surely becomes a well-established gangster. However, Tony becomes greedier and more consumed with power as the days go by, and it's only a matter of time before he starts to want it all.  His &quot;wanting it all&quot; leads him to his ultimate demise that will consume his fate.  This is a story about starting with nothing and then having everything--only to lose it all in then end.<p>Words cannot even begin to describe how passionately I feel about this movie.  This is a crime saga that has layers of character and story.  It isn't just a senseless bloodbath with mindless violence around every corner.  No, this movie has a certain path and structure.  Al Pacino literally makes the role of &quot;Tony Montana&quot; his own and never loses sight of it for a second.  I can't think of another character that is &quot;impersonated&quot; in the real world more than Pacino's &quot;Tony Montana.&quot;  The film is brilliantly written by Oliver Stone (who deemed this movie as his farewell to cocaine), and is perfectly executed by director Brian DePalma.  This film had an amazing cast and crew behind it, which made it the success that it is today.<p>This Two-Disk Anniversary Edition is fully packed with some great extras.  One of the main things that is so great about the DVD is the incredible audio and picture transfer that is COMPLETELY superb in contrast with the older version.  While it's easier to note the difference in picture with a bigger (and perhaps even a widescreen) television, you should still be able to tell the difference and come to the conclusion that this new transfer is much better than the original.  Extra features included are deleted scenes, documentaries, a &quot;TV Version&quot; montage that is absolutely priceless, and a hip-hop feature that shows interviews with some of today's hottest rappers and how they deem this movie as a &quot;ghetto classic.&quot;  While the DVD could've had a few more extra features, it is in no way disappointing.<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is a timeless classic that seems to get bigger and bigger as the years roll by.  It's a rare breed of film that can never be duplicated in a successful manner.  I find it truly amazing how a film started off so weak when it first came out only to become the legend that it is today.  If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend that you give it a viewing as soon as possible.  It is, and forever will be, one of my absolute favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>For Mature Audiences only!  Not for children to see.

Shrewdly, Castro also unlocks the overpacked prisons, allowing hordes of criminals to join the refugees. Tony Montana, a small time hood, is one of them. In Florida, Montana connects with gangster Frank Lopez, and guns his way through the sun washed streets of Miami where he finds power, wealth and passion. He kills Lopez and marries his mistress, Elvira. Montana, better known as "Scarface," soon becomes the leader of a bloody cocaine-smuggling empire but at a terrible cost to his sister, Gina and his loyal friend, Manny. However, like that of others before him, Montana's reign is brief and a violent end is guaranteed as rival gangster compete to become the next drug lord. Those who have not seen this movie be forewarned. It is one of the most graphic, vulgar movies...well...pretty much I think ever made. definitely not for the weak of heart, unless you can handle chainsaws and point-blank shotgun kills. IF that's your thing, then this is your movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I found this to be an interesting character study of a Cuban who comes to Miami and becomes a big drug dealer, rising from poverty to become a wealthy big-shot....and then destroying himself. The real down side to living the life of crime is detailed in the story.  Near the end, Pacino is going to bed each night with a gun under his pillow.  Anyone who thinks being a big-time crook is "the life," should watch this film and pay attention.<br /><br />The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence....but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff, the film is now almost reaching "cult status." Now those same flip-flop national critics like it. Amazing.<br /><br />At the time of this movie's release, Al Pacino ("Tony Montana") probably set a new Hollywood record for using the f-word in a mainline film, Now it's topped by anyone who performs in a Martin Scorcese film.  Pacino's wife, "Elvira" played by the beautiful Michelle Peiffer, wasn't a lot more clean-mouthed than her husband. She got really brutal as the film wore on.<br /><br />If that language is no problem for you, you'll find the story quite interesting and a good study of how paranoia must wind up haunting most gangsters.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Its funny how one of the most repulsive movies I have watched has quickly become a cult classic favorite in my eyes.  Though some people who love this movie see it for entertainment purposes (and the "Say hello to my little friend" scene is certainly one of the most entertaining in cinematic history) much more can certainly be said about the real purpose behind Scraface.  A simple message is implied by the end of the film, though its pretty obvious from nearly the beginning as well, and that is, now matter how much you "fly straight" in this dirty business, your fate is basically already written.  Its almost ironic.  Scarface is easily the cliche of a film you never want your children to see, yet at the same time, the message and the way that is portrayed is something they need to understand, though with the 200+ "f" words and the excessive violence and drug content, it probably is better to play it safe about allowing younger audiences to watch Scarface.  However, compared to films like the present day American Gangster with Denzel Washington, Scarface is beginning to feel milder all the time.<br /><br />Al Pacino is the star here, naturally, and its amazing how different his acting abilites for his Cuban character "Tony Montana" are compared to his famous role in The Godfather.  It takes a bit to get used to the accent, but his lines become those you love to quote, and eventually you want to both love and hate Tony Montana at the same time.  The supporting cast is just as impressive, but considering the film was released in 1983, you have to expect a couple of cheesy, overacting at some point.  Same goes for the music.  I actually love the score, though it is very 80's with songs like "She's on Fire" played in the club.<br /><br />The movie takes a patient watch, running a little under 3 hours in time.  Scenes either move along quickly or get dragged down, but when the action roles it stay real and perfecly in flow with the story.  Aside from the final shootout in the film, the gun fire scenes and other forms of violence are just enough to progress the plot, instead of providing mass entertainment (though with this kind of film, violence for entertainment purposes begins to tread over tricky waters).<br /><br />Scarface has become one of those films everyone needs to watch at least once.  Whether you will like it or hate in in the end, it has become so popular you just have to find out what all the hype is about.  It really is a great film, and chances are you may only dislike it for the obsessive dirty business protrayed.  It can be entertaining to some, but also realize the film makes a point and says something.  With that said, I believe its possible for anyone to enjoy this film.  Scarface doesn't have the best action, acting, etc. in a film, but it certainly goes down as one of greatest Gangster movies of all time with a teriffic story.<br /><br />The Platinum edition has been remastered, both video and audio.  The video wasn't overaly impressive, but the audio was fantastic, especially the gun explosions in the finale.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>"I always tell the truth, even if I lie. First you get the money. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you the power, you get the women. You wanna play rough?" And so on and so on. Whether you love "Scarface" or you love throwing fireworks at bee hives (after futile searches for wasp hives), we all know those beautiful unforgettable lines.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not being fair when I call this the greatest gangster film ever made but hey, that's life. This contains truckloads of scenes that all have their way of sticking around in your brain, and then some filler material in which virtually nobody gets whacked. But the source of fuel of this is the brilliant Al Pacino who as few stars do, brings his lines like he's being paid millions of dollars for it.<br /><br />Al Pacino hunger and determination to make it to the top of the drug trade is strangely inspiring, in a society which regards him as scum of the earth. The longer the film rolls, the more crazy our Al becomes. But you find yourself drawn to his character wanting him to keep on getting bigger and bigger! The action is exciting and disturbing at times, which makes it all the more believable. The supporting casts are all good, and easily transport you into the Miami under world. Overall the film is full of unforgettable scenes, quotable one liners and a stellar performance from a living legend. A great film!!</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Scarface is a crime masterpiece.

It is hinted these exiled people are far from being clean. They are the dregs of society and coming directly out of prison. Scarface is no exception. He is scum and scum he will remain till the end. The Americans are not lured at all, at least the police, but they are under strong pressure to provide these poor refugees with "libertad". As soon as Scarface gets that freedom he starts his business, from scratch and from the bottom, but he knows how to climb fast and how to get rid of obstacles and his road is punctuated with bodies or parts of bodies. In no time at all he is the boss and he is able to realize his ambition: millions from the opening Colombian route (cocaine of course) whereas those he eliminated to get in their place were only making a few grands. But the story of this man is the story of a paranoid and schizophrenic sociopath. He climbs to power and cannot see he has to share that power with newcomers. He defends his territory like a lion or a grizzly bear and his power becomes a war, a constant war in which everything and everyone is destroyed. That makes a perfect action film full of violence as if it were loaded with cocaine, but with a more human dimension in the character of Scarface himself who is impersonated marvelously by Al Pacino. The acting is so good that it transcends the pure bloody violence of the images and the plot. We can admire how Brian de Palma paints and composes his character to make him so true to what we can believe. He becomes a masterpiece in that psychological line in spite of the total absence of any other depth, social, cultural, political or whatever.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This is probably De Palma's best film and one of Al Pacino's best as well.

In his lifetime, he's been in so many classic films (The Godfather Trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon, Heat, Carlito's Way, Scent of a Woman, etc.). Scarface is definitely one of his greatest performances. Everyone who is a fan of this film, including me, can always enjoy the amount of F-words that Tony Montana (Pacino) bellows out of his mouth, or how much the character really just kicks a**. Sure, it's dark and disturbingly violent, but that's what makes it so recognizable. And it's almost amazing how this film has become a direct influence in the hip hop genre. I like hip hop, but I don't think this film should be connected with a particular music genre because it should stand on its own.<br /><br />So Pacino as Tony Montana, the gruesome violence, the insane profanity, the supporting cast (especially Bauer and Pheiffer), the 80's music, and the epic battle at the end of the film ("Say hello to ma little fwend!") makes this one of the greatest cult hits of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Brian DePalma has never been known for his subtlety, and Oliver Stone was just beginning his career as a screen-writer of kerosene soaked volatility. In 1983, when they released the violently over-the-top "Scarface,' a lot of film-goers didn't know what to make of it. Hundreds of F-Words and thousands of gunshots in the life of a Cuban Drug Lord outraged the Cuban community and offended the morally fragile. Yet some 25 years later, Al Pacino's burning portrayal of Tony Montana continues to resonate. And there has not been a Gangster movie made since that doesn't owe to "Scarface's" legacy. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729725">GoodFellas</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather</a>, "Scarface" redefined the way this stlye of movie is made and viewed.<br /><br />Perhaps the bizarre affinity gangster rappers have for this has overwhelmed the actual film's content (dudes, Tony becomes an impotent paranoid man before his inevitable bloody end), but the look of the film is amazing. "Scarface" takes its time and comes to a boil ever so slowly as Tony first lands in "Freedomtown" before he starts to climb to the top. Despite the hype of the violence, much of the actual death and destruction is implies (the infamous chainsaw sequence in particular), and Tony even tries to cling to a certain moral code. Murdering an enemy is fine, but not the enemy's kids.<br /><br />DePalma also sticks to a filmatic elegance, allowing cameras slow-pans and eschewing rapid cut editing, while also infusing the film with stabs of humor. (Personal favorite, the job offer in Frank's car dealership.) The color scheme is strictly tied to its time; colors will make you flashback to old Miami Vice episodes and Giorgi Moroder's score just screams "dated." (However, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000UX4XA">Soundtrack</a> does include one exquisite Debbie Harry single.) Given DePalma's legendary fight with the ratings board over the violence and language, he could have easily clipped the film down from its near three hour running time, but he held his ground and delivered the movie he wanted. Love it or hate it, "Scarface" is a visionary movie that has deservedly left its mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>As a teenager, I was a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ULPFGI">Miami Vice: The Complete Series</a>, and I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a> so I bought this 2 disk Anniversary edition of Scarface.<br /><br />At the time I purchased this, I had been listening to many Gangsta Rap and Hip Hop CDs, and I've read that many musicians are inspired by this film.  The Special Features explore the music industry's fascination with this classic movie.<br /><br />This is literally a story of "rags to riches," and this is also a story of becoming power mad.  I was completely engaged and mesmerized by his rise to power, but it is sad to see that he let his power become paranoia and he hit his personal stash instead of being a business man.  He reminds me of Uncle Sam, right now.  Too much power, but not enough Self Control.<br /><br />America loves (and often votes for) its Gangsters, and this is a great tribute to the ideals of North America.  At the risk of being labled a "Turahist," I love this movie and so do most North Americans.  Sad ending, but a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>scarface is one of my very favorites. this movie is very powerful, beautifully done, and one of the most influential of all time. no matter how many movies al pacino does, he will always be known as tony montana aka scarface no matter what. this role was made for him, he was born for this. the rise and fall of this man, the love he won and lost, the power he earned and abused, the drugs he bought, sold, did, and that destroyed him. at the end he went out like a real man, taking a lot of fools with him. he went down like a soldier, but they killed him from the back like cowards. this was the life for him, the life he dreamed of, the life he achieved, but in the end it caught up to him. it always does. it got to him. the life and everything that came with it. for a brief moment the world was his. a guaranteed pleaser. no doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Al Pacino plays as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant whom arrives in Miami Flordia to become the cocaine king of the city and the most successful one at that. However, it becomes a living hell when he fights against the other mobs of the city, his sister having affairs with other men and his relationship with a beautiful woman named Elviria ( Michelle Pfeifer) is mixed when he's going out killing for Coke ( the drug, not the drink).<br /><br />This happens to be Al Pacino's signature role! this 1983 crime drama is a definite epic of the genre, it was trashed by some critics but made a decent box-office success and a huge cult following even among today's hip-hop stars. This is a brutal, gory and entertaining 3-hour tour-de force from director Brian De Palma that is definitely not for everybody but it's a must see movie and one of my top 109 favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />The new 2-Disc anniversary Edition DVD has awesome picture & great sound quality. It has a second disc which contains very good extras like featurettes on how the movie got from remaking a classic 1932 gangster flick, the casting, the controverseries on getting the movie a "R" rating instead of an "X" rating and how it became a cult classic, it also has a interesting documentary on how this movie inspired the lives of the popular rap artists in the music industry and a funny montage of how the theatrical release compares with the censored TV version.<br /><br />This movie is strongly recommended, definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Leon The Professional", " Kill Bill series", " Pulp Fiction", "L.A. Confidential", "Gangs of New York", " Reservoir Dogs", " The Godfather trilogy", " Goodfellas", " Assault on Precinct 13" ( original and remake), and " Se7en".</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is an incredible film about the rise and fall of a Cuban refugee in Miami, FL in the early 1980s.<p>This film revolves around Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who came to this country when Fidel Castro expelled many of this citizens (and criminals) to the United States in 1980. Tony and his friends soon discover the world of cocaine and begin selling it. Tony builds an empire out of this business and eventually becomes a very powerful man. However, all of the power soon comes to an end when a hit is placed on him. The climactic scene at the end (containing the now famous line, &quot;say hello to my little friend!&quot; will leave you in awe!<p>Al Pacino gives what I believe is an Oscar-worthy performance as Tony Montana, while the very young Michelle Pfeiffer portrays his cocaine-addicted wife. The film can quite violent at times and very strong language is used often, so you might want to put the kids to bed before watching this one.<p>The second disc containing all of the special features is a gem within itself. It contains deleted scenes, how the film came to fruition, and a short documentary about how &quot;Scarface&quot; has influenced many of the hip-hop artists today.<p>Overall, I would give this film and its special features 10 stars. Even though Tony chose to go into the business of cocaine, it shows how a person coming from virtually nothing can become one of the most power people in the country if his or her drive is strong enough. Like the movie says, &quot;The world is yours!&quot; I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a DVD player. It's a film that I think everyone should see at least once in their lives, whether you're into gangster films or not. You will not be disappointed at all!!! Watch this film!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; has finally been given the proper DVD treatment with this special 20th anniversary edition of the movie. While originally dismissed by film critics as an ultra-glossy celebration of violence, profanity, and drug use, this movie has now earned its rank as a modern-day classic. Al Pacino's ultra-charismatic performance of Cuban refugee turned drug kingpin, Tony Montana is certainly the highlight of this massive crime epic. <p>Tony and his partner, Manolo have exiled from Cuba and are looking to capitalize on the &quot;American dream&quot;. Starting off as foot soldiers for boss Frank Lopez, they soon move their way up the ladder in the world of drug-dealing. With bloodbaths and double-crosses at every turn of the corner, Tony eventually finds himself on top of the drug kingdom with Lopez's beautiful girlfriend (Michelle Pfeifer) as his wife and a fortune in drug money at his disposal. <p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is not a beautiful love story. It is in its essence, a tale of capitalism gone awry. While Pacino's Montana is often viewed as a loyal guy, it is his greed that manages to destroy not only himself but everyone around him. He fiends for his boss' girlfriend out of lust, not love. His relationship with this character is never treated as a romance. She is a prize that comes with the territory. The only person Tony does seem to have unconditional love for is his sister but even that love is of a such a controlling nature that he never allows for her to find true happiness. By the end of the second act, Tony is so caught up in his world of greed and drug-enduced paranoia that he seems all but finished. The murder of his best friend seems to foreshadow his own downfall.<p>This movie has become a staple of pop culture. Montana's trademark lines have been quoted in every movie from FRIDAY to ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS. While it was originally best known for its violence in such scenes as the infamous chainsaw sequence and the bullet-riddled conclusion, &quot;Scarface&quot; has grown to be a larger-than-life film.<br /><br />While this movie is revered by many as a true classic, the film itself is flawed but it is in those subtle imperfections that we have come to know and love this film. Pacino's trademark accent is ridicilous but appealing nonetheless. In fact, most of the Cuban characters are played by Italian-American actors. Steven Bauer, one of the select few authentic Cuban actors in the film is entertaining in his portrayal of Manolo, Tony's sidekick. <p>This &quot;special edition&quot; DVD presentation is amazing. We get an in-depth look at the making of the film, deleted scenes, and an explanation of the influence of the film on today's audience. This DVD is definetly an essential addition to any true film buff's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>If you know the whole story behind SCARFACE, then let me sum up this entire review for you: SCARFACE is a classic and is not to be missed - it does, indeed, come extremely close to being a masterpiece.  Loosely remade from the 1932 film of the same name, Al Pacino stars as the title character, a Cuban refugee who takes over a drug empire in 1980's Florida.  When first released in 1983, SCARFACE turned off many of it's viewers when they saw that (at that time) SCARFACE held the record for the use of the "f"-word.  The film that later took up the record, CASINO, is very similar to this film, in that they both center around a man with nothing who gets everything and then looses it because of his greed.  Brian De Palma's directing isn't exactly wonderful; Pacino's performance, however, is as the angered Tony Montana.  There's also an excellent score by Giorgio Moroder, and a nifty little 80's soundtrack.  SCARFACE may not be a masterpiece, but it's a cult classic and a true must-see for film fanatics.  "Say hello to my little friend!"</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This film has a couple of things against it.  It's a remake (I hate remakes), and it's directed by Brian de Palma, who has made a career of paying homage to Hitchcock and other directors a little too closely at times, but when he clicks, he can be electric.  This film is one of the most electric, intense, and violent films I ever saw.  It still has the same impact that it did when it was released.  It shows that remakes can be great.  This film is completely its own, really only using the title of the original and the same theme.  This film is far superior to the original, and is a work of art in many ways.  It has some of the most quotable dialogue ever written in a movie (is there a rap album out there that DOESN'T sample this movie), and everyone that has seen loves this film.  It had such an influence on hip-hop culture.  Kudos to Oliver Stone who wrote the screenplay (people sometimes forget about that) and de Palma for making such an excessive masterpiece.  The critics hated this when it came out (except, most notably, Roger Ebert), comparing it to The Godfather, and, of course, The Godfather won.  The Godfather was a completely different type of gangster movie.  It's still excellent, but this is on a completely different level.  Pacino should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for one of his best roles.  He had had a bad streak (Cruising, Bobby Deerfield, Author!, Author!), and many critics dumped on him for this.  They shouldn't.  This is probably his most memorable role, even though he's done great work elsewhere.  I'm tempted to put in a gratuitous rap reference right now, but I'll refrain.  Great filmmaking...</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Scarface exists on it's own terms - as a cautionary tale about a Cuban punk who arrives in Miami in 1980 and works his way to the top of the Cocaine power-heap, but it also begs comparison to Al Pacino's other work as that other famous gangster - Michael Corleone in the Godfather films.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's screenplay forms the foundation for Brian De Palma's film, and the violence and language are exceedingly raw.  This is not a film for the easily offended.  In fact, you could have a pretty strong stomach for excess violence and the F word and still be a little worn out by the end.<br /><br />Pacino's Anthony Montana has no redeeming qualities.  He has all the deadly sins, and double doses of most of them.  Where The Godfather's Michael Corleone is a conflicted character, Tony is sociopath through and through.  Michael Corleone begins the Godfather movies with no intention of getting involved in the family "business", and by the end he has become one of the strongest gangsters on earth.  He dreams of "going legitimate" and at various points in ALL of the Godfather films Michael ponders his place in the crime universe and how he can separate his life of crime from his family - who he seems to legitimately love.  Tony Montana in "Scarface" has NO ambition of going straight - only of becoming a MORE powerful druglord.  He treats women and his friends like dirt and walks through life with an arrogance that is, at best, unpleasant.  When he is REALLY riled he is capable of just about anything, and this film shows his character doing pretty much that - just about anything.<br /><br />De Palma's direction is a cut above average, and the cast of Pacino, Pfeiffer and some excellent support from Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Steven Bauer perform their roles adequately, but by the end I couldn't get over the feeling that I was essentially watching an extremely violent soap opera with a good cast.<br /><br />I'd say about 3.5 stars, but I'll round it to 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>This is one of the greatest movies of all time and the AFI top 100 movies of all time refuses to acknowledge it. Al Pacino deserved an oscar for his portrayal of Tony Montana, the movie deserved an oscar for something yet this movie is constantly overlooked by all critics, but the cult following that it has amassed is by far more telling of it's popularity than sheer box office numbers. ask anyone on the street and they'll tell you Scarface is one of the best movies ever made, and if they don't think so they haven't seen it.

Al Pacino looks overacted in every frame of the picture, and his recent acting in the Godfather II makes of his character a simple extension of Michel Corleone. I know every one of Brian de Palma previous works and I guess he wanted to add a different and renovated gaze to this terrible gangster. But I think there was an exaggeration touch all over the film, making it perhaps extremely narcissist and hyper realist.  In the other hand it seems a big task to try to demystify Howard Hawks' s Scarface.<br />But the huge talent and his magic handle of camera save the film, leading it to secure port.

One of five good films De Palma ever made out of 20 or more really bad ones(The Untouchables; Carrie; Carlito's Way; and Mission Impossible are the others.)<br /><br />The film's plot is pretty simple in that it follows the rise and fall of the central character: his family relationships and his dealings with society as well as other crime syndicates.  Although the film has every trapping of a cheesy 1980s film as with every other De Palma film, Al Pacino's brilliant performance along with the talents of the supporting actors (Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Robert Loggia) make this film a classic.<br /><br />This is another great mob film that should be in everyone's collection without exception: don't be without it!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Brian De Palma's epic blood soaked remake of the 1932 Paul Muni gangster classic may not have gotten all the critical acclaim in the world, but it stands as a landmark performance of the great Al Pacino. Pacino brings to the screen one of his most well known characters in his career as Tony Montana; a cuban refugee who rises to power in Miami's cocaine underworld. Along with him is his best friend Manny (Steve Bauer) and the two begin working for Frank (Robert Loggia), a slimy, manipulative excess driven drug kingpin whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) Tony soon develops an obsession for. Oliver Stone wrote the script and helped make Tony one of the most unforgettable characters in all of American cinema. Scarface has since become a cult classic and contains some of the most memorable lines of dialogue in film, not to mention the most rampant use of profanity that would not be topped for years to come. The only problem I ever had with Scarface was it's length; clocking in at nearly 3 hours, there are times when the film drags, but that is only a minor complaint. All in all, if you want to see one of Al Pacino's finest performances (aside from Devil's Advocate, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, or anything beginning with the title The Godfather), then consider Scarface essential viewing, but be warned, this is not a film for all tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Hard to believe it took me until now (February 2007) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made Scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's. I loved this movie.<br /><br />It really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense. Watch it now.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I could never figure out the appeal of SCARFACE in the years after it came out.<br /><br />Easy to watch but easily discarded.  This story brings out the worst of Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma.  And Al Pacino for that matter.  His Tony Montana is almost a parody of a coked-out Cuban drug dealer.  Tony is a scumbag.  He was a scumbag in Cuba, he was dumped on Miami where he really excelled as a scumbag, and he ended up in a gloriously over-the-top scumbag death.<br /><br />The movie came out in the 1980s and was pretty much forgotten...until rap music.  Then the rappers gave SCARFACE a second life.  When they're not shooting at each other, they're worshipping Tony Montana.  I live in the Western U.S. and you can chart any mall's decline when posters and blankets and wall hangings of Tony Montana begin appearing in the storefront windows.  SCARFACE is a thug's dream.  Its enduring popularity owes more to the growing scumbag population in our popular culture than any cinematic merit of its own.<br /><br />But the movie is watchable.  I just watched the beginning on cable again the other night.  But it wallows in excesses and never makes you care about anyone in it.<br /><br />To make my point: try to imagine how it would play if Tony Montana went into business with the Corleone Family from THE GODFATHER PARTS 1 and 2 (I don't acknowledge PART 3) or even the equally-violent but much better developed thugs from GOODFELLAS.  How does Tony stack up against real characters now?</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>While there's no doubt Pacino's Scarface is a semi-riveting and immensely watchable film (hey; you know about the extreme violence and language going in, so you really can't complain about that), it really hasn't aged all that well. Tony Montana is so swaggering, showy and larger-than-life a character, he manages to become a parody of himself within the confines of the film. Watching the movie today, Montana doesn't emerge as someone to emulate or admire, but someone to ultimately regard as pathetic. He lets pride, ego and money blind him to everything else in life, including rational thinking and common sense. (By contrast, many other drug-dealer films do include more of a personal-life level). In some ways, the whole movie has an almost cartoonish feel to it. Bottom line: this Scarface just hasn't withstood the test of time except as a cult flick. The 1932 version is simply timeless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Hubby ordered this box set from ebay. He was very happy with the perches. We watched Scareface (1983) a lot. But we never bothered to watch Scareface (1932). I just finished watching Scareface (1932) and I'm not into it.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be just like Scareface from (1983). Because so many times they get old movies like Scareface (1932) and up date them. But it wasn't. There were some scenes that were the same as the newer Scareface. But it started out different and played out different.<br /><br />One scene that bothered me in Scareface (1932) is when the cops were shooting at his house. His sister was just shot and instead of trying to save his self or fight back he just lays by his sisters side telling her not to die. I can understand him laying next to her for a few minutes. But he lay's next to her telling her not to die and getting mad at her for dying for a long time. What does he want her to do? Get up and say ok Tony because you told me not to.... lol. Even after he got up to save his self he keeps calling out to her. I think that part was dumb.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>This movie shows two friends going through tough time in life. Movie does not have a lot of special effects, but the action is packed with surprizes. This is one of the best acts of Alpachino. good movie you should watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Every so often, a film comes along that changes the cinematic landscape. A film that sets a new vanguard for motion pictures. A film that both influences and alienates. A film that stands the test of time as a masterpiece. "Scarface" is one of those movies. When it was first released in 1983, "Scarface" caused challenged the MPAA with its excessive use of violence, foul language and other cinematic taboos. Director Brian DePalma, screenwriter Oliver Stone, star Al Pacino and others involved with the film made sure that this film would become what it is today.<br /><br />There's no use in describing the plot, as anyone who hasn't been living under a rock since 1983 already knows it. Tony Montana (Pacino) is a Cuban immigrant who arrives at Mariel Harbor, in Miami, 1980. There, he gets involved in the only thing he knows how to do - drug dealing. Tony becomes rich. He has it all: money, women, power. However, as the stakes get higher, so does Tony (figuratively and literally). He throws away everything he earned and by the end of the movie, he can never get it back.<br /><br />This film is so powerful on so many different levels. This is more than just the film that made "Say Hello To My Little Friend" an international catchphrase. This is more than just the film that set the record for most uses of the "f" word (well over 200). This is more than just a typical shoot-em-up with oodles and oodles of violence. Look past all this silly stuff and you will find that "Scarface" is disturbing realistic and often terrifying in its brutal depiction of life. This film has influenced millions, from filmmakers to gangsta rappers. "Scarface" is a celluloid treasure.<br /><br />The way this film was done was perfect. The scenrery? Awe-inspiring. The directing? Superb. The script? Flawless. The acting? Phenomenal. Al Pacino has never done a better role than this. Had this film cut down on the cursing and possibly the length, Pacino would have definitely won an Oscar. The rest of the supporting cast deliver impeccable performances as well, including Steven Bauer, Maria Mastrentonio, Robert Loggia and especially Michelle Pfeiffer, who, at an early stage in her career, manages to steal the show from Pacino and everyone else at every chance she gets. Her final scene in the restaurant is unforgettable. Like Pacino, Michelle definitely deserved the Academy Award that year.<br /><br />Which brings us to the dvd itself. How does this 22 year old masterpiece look on dvd. Well, it looks and sounds great. The 5.1 sound and the Anamorphic Widescreen let you see and hear the movie like it was meant to be. As for bonus features, this film is, as Tony Montana might say, loaded. Deleted scenes, a slew of documenatries and various interviews with the cast and crew are all present and accounted for on this dvd.<br /><br />If you haven't seen "Scarface", you are depriving yourself of a work of art. Get it immediately.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Scarface' is one of those classic films that, even though it wasn't recognized by prestigious awards ceremonies as worthy, it'll be remembered far longer than films like `Crash' and `Million Dollar Baby'.  Why?  Well for starters it's really what made Al Pucino famous.  Sure, he was in `The Godfather' films and he was brilliant in them (the Oscar nods prove that) but to me `The Godfather' belongs to Brando, but `Scarface', not that is in all respects Al's picture, from start to finish, it belongs to Pucino.<br /><br />Pucino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant in the United States who goes from petty criminal to drug lord.  He double crosses, gets double crossed, gains respect, losses respect and does a lot of coke.  Throughout the film Tony can always rely on his best friend Manny (Steven Bauer), that is until Manny starts second guessing Tony's way of operation, and even more so starts seeing Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) even after Tony forbade it.  His sister Gina and his love for her (and wonton control of her life) is in the end what ruins this man.<br /><br />My favorite performance though came from Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Elvira Hancock, the wife of Tony's business partner who he eventually steals away and marries himself.  She is fascinated with the life (as is shown by her constant snorting habits) but she is also growing tired of Tony's ways so much so that she is beginning to resent him and everything he stands for.<br /><br />Al does a wonderful job with infusing Tony with the right amount of passion and drive to offset his cocky arrogance.  No, the acting isn't top notch award worthy acting (his accent is terrible) but he has so much fun with his performance that in a way it's legendary.  Tony Montana will go down in history as an icon of cinema, someone that all generations are drawn to and `Scarface' as a whole will always be remembered, regardless of what the Academy thinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>A MOVIE WITCH SPEAK OF THE WORLD OF THE GANGSTERS WICH ARE IN PROVENANCE OF CUBA !

Say hello to my little friend!&quot;<br />- Tony Montana, a.k.a. Scarface.<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; chronicles the life of a Cuban refugee who came to America in May, 1980, when Fidel Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Bay, Cuba, with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their families back in America. As the movie's opening intro explains, it soon became obvious that Castro was doing little more than sending the scum of Cuba to America in hopes of ridding his domain of filth. Of the 125,000 Cubans who came to America that year, an estimated 25,000 had criminal backgrounds.<p>Antonio Montana (Al Pacino) was one of those criminals who came to America from Cuba and successfully set up his own kingdom of cocaine, wealth and greed. We see him in the first few minutes of the film being interviewed by police regarding his background. He's asked about the scar that stretches from his eyebrow down to his cheek. He gives all the right responses and is sent off to a quarantine camp along with his long-time friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). After murdering a man in the camp as a favor for a Mafia kingpin named Frank (Robert Loggia), the two buddies are given green cards and released from the camp. Eventually they land another job for Frank. Their wealth and greed starts to grow.<p>Every time we see Tony Montana he is a bit better off. Better clothes, better means of transportation. He visits his mother at her small little home in Miami to show off his fortune. He tries to give her money but she says that people like him give bad names to the hard-working Cubans (like herself) who have come to America and work legitimately for a living.<p>But Tony's sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) doesn't think so. She adores her brother and accepts 1,000 dollars from him as a present. But it backfires--soon Gina is hanging out in the fancy clubs and getting felt up by men. Tony sees this and anger lights up in his eyes like fire. This happens twice in the movie. Both times are in regards to his sister. Manny explains to Gina that Tony doesn't want her to turn out like him because she is the only thing pure left in his life.<p>Soon Tony is so powerful that he overthrows Frank and marries his girl (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes so depressed that she sleeps all day and snorts all night. &quot;Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that, Tony.&quot;<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is based on Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same title that starred Paul Muni as the title character. Both movies were accused of being overly violent. Both characters from the films had a strange infatuation with their sisters. Both characters fell in love with their boss' girlfriend. But the similarities end there. The 1932 version was not about a Cuban, it was not about an empire built on drugs, and it was not very similar by any account. Al Pacino said that Muni's performance inspired him to become Tony Montana. And while some critics accuse Pacino's performance of being over the top and too flamboyant, think about this: His character is a Cuban refugee who came to America and killed people for a living before taking over an empire built on drugs and crime. He lives in fear of not only others but himself. As his life proceeds he snorts cocaine so often that he can barely think. Then he has the underlying guilt of his life bearing down on his shoulders. How over the top would you act?<p>The movie was written by Oliver Stone, who completed a final draft after many attempts by other writers, including one attempt by the director of the movie, Brian DePalma, who claims that his script was not going the way he wanted it to go. Stone made the story his, and succeeds on almost all levels of storytelling. Back when &quot;Scarface&quot; was released drugs, violence and big blowouts at the end of a movie were hardly run-o'-the-mill. The 160 + F-words in the film were not exactly standard, either. But the story is involving and sad. It is the best film about the American Dream ever made. Tony Montana wanted the world, and when he finally got what he wanted, he realized that even the world was not enough. Perhaps the best and most important scene in &quot;Scarface&quot; is the subtlest one--when Tony is sitting at his desk after he has killed Manny. He has everything he ever dreamed about and wanted in front of him--drugs, drinks, a luxurious mansion, a beautiful wife. Yet it isn't enough for him. And the reason he sits there in silence for so long is because it is then that he realizes happiness does not come from material wealth, but from the inside. And, to be honest, Tony Montana doesn't really have much of a soul inside. And he knows it. <p>&quot;Scarface&quot; opens with its own theme song and closes with it, as well. It is more than just coincidence--when it is played in the beginning of the movie, it is during the time of Mariel Bay, and hope is everywhere for criminals. When it plays at the end, we have witnessed the American Dream from start to finish. When it plays at the end, there is no hope left for anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>It is not a subtle story Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone are telling in &quot;Scarface,&quot; nor is it a subtle metaphor; the saga of exiled Cuban criminal Tony Montana (Al Pacino) zooming to the top of the American capitalist structure with his drug empire, then plunging, seemingly belly flop first, into death is a beat-you-with-a-hammer version of &quot;The Godfather.&quot; <p>The ruthlessness of the film makes it particularly popular in our more ruthless times - the hip-hop nation, led by mogul P. Diddy's claim that he wishes he could watch it 24 hours a day, seems especially plugged in to whatever moral Stone and DePalma are trying to pitch, so much so, a documentary on its effect is included in the DVD package. To be fair to Stone, his scripts remained defiant and ambitious. He just directed them better.<p>Looking at it again, 20 years later, the movie has painfully dated in some ways, not in others. Pacino's performance is still foolishly over-the-top - sadly, his portrayal of the cartoonish, slurring Montana seemed to inform just about every job he's done since by getting THIS LOUD every time a minutely important moment occurs on screen, the restrained examples being &quot;Sea of Love&quot; and &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; - while the rise/fall plotline follows too direct, simplistic a line. The shades played out in the &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; and the Pacino/DePalma reteam in &quot;Carlito's Way&quot; are not there in Montana. He's straight crazy, a surviving virus finally met with himself by movie's end, only with more guns. <p>More memorable now is the performance by Mary Stuart Mastrantonio, as Tony's sister, a sweet girl pulled further into Tony's world until she is of it and able to play just a dangerous game as Tony after her lover (and Tony's partner) Manolo (Steven Bauer) is killed by Tony, ostensibly because Tony would in secret prefer his sister for himself.<br /><br />The enduring legacy of &quot;Scarface,&quot; as shown clearly in the hip-hop documentary, is that it's big, bold, violent, filled with ugly mantras (&quot;the power, the money, the women&quot;) material items, gorgeous women and hidden passions, such as incest, that only within the reach of a true showstopper psycho like Tony. Though Montana dies, Pacino packs so much bravado in his death that even that moment is glorified as a fitting end - that to have it all, lose it all, die and do it with a strut is the key to a short, happy life. The more recent &quot;Blow&quot; isn't nearly as exciting, but its lines aren't blurred; &quot;Scarface,&quot; intentionally, I think, cheerfully endorsed Tony in 1983, and still does. It's entertainment, extremely well-filmed entertainment, but ugly, and at its core, rotten. It's admirable and loathsome in equal portions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I saw "Scarface" when it came out in video some years back.  I had heard that it originally received an "X" rating before heading back to the cutting room.  I understood that the "X" was for its'violent content rather than for any sexual content.  I can't think of many films that faced that editting problem.  I believe I may have seen the original cut because a later viewing was certainly tamer than the first one.  There are many scenes of violence that are disturbing but the most hideous involved a compatriot, a chainsaw, and a bathtub.  I've never been able to erase that particular scene from my memory.<br /><br />"Scarface" tells the story of a man who will stop at nothing to reach the top.  In the case of Tony Montana (compellingly played by Al Pacino), the top is the top of the drug world.  He does a quick study in analyzing the business; who's in power, how did they acquire their power, how do they exercise their power, what are their weaknesses, etc.  The brutality and the "win at any cost" mentality of Pacino turns "Scarface" into a bizarre sort of morality play on the perils of ruthless ambition.  In its' extremes, the point seemingly is made; or is it?  I had put much of "Scarface" (save several scenes) out of my mind until my recent vacation.  I noticed, as I visited urban areas of Central and Southern USA, that there was a lot of "Scarface" related items for sale from men's clothing showing the sillouhette of Tony Montana to wall decorations showing the same thing.  Where is this coming from?  Is the message of the anti-hero lost on a subsequent generation that idolizes a fictional character who murders his way to the top?  Heaven help us if it is.  Perhaps it was that mentality that we saw in the anarchic violence in the recent flooded streets of New Orleans.  "Scarface" was a very disturbing movie that, I presume, was intended to show the futility of the violent life.<br /><br />In regards to the quality of the movie, I have to give it a fairly strong rating because the acting, directing, and writing is pretty good.  However, "Scarface" fails in quality because of its' "in your face" violence.  I mentioned the scene with the chain saw.  Probably equal in impact to me was a scene that took place at a night club the evening that Tony Montana was marked for asassination.  There was an act that was introduced which was the symbol of innocence.  You could tell from the audience reaction that this entertainer was a nice, clean, fun act and it was in the midst of his performance that the machine guns of the would-be asassins opened fire.  In the aftermath we see, in all of the death and destruction, the fallen body of this innocent entertainer.  The chain saw was about them; the entertainer was about us.  The chain saw told us that violence succumbs to violence; the entertainer told us that the violent in our midst makes us all vulnerable. The talent that made this subtle message apparently did so just to let us know they could do it.  Afterwards it was back to the same of blood and guts on film.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>Another classic example of how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Baloney (and that's putting it very mildly). This film is simply a waste of time & talent. 2 hours, 49 minutes of f-bombs spewed everywhere. I don't mind watching a movie with profanity & violence, but there's got to be a good storyline to go with it (the "Lethal Weapon" movies, for example) This movie was utterly a waste of my time. I ain't seeing it again. The Greatest Movie Of All Time?!!! B.S.!!! "Beauty And The Beast" is the greatest movie ever made (I grew up watching it, so naturally I'm in favour of it). I love "Gone With The Wind" & I personally think all the classics (and "Beauty And The Beast" is certainly a classic) are much better, both enrtertainment & moral-wise, than this 2 hour 49 minute p.o.s. Maybe "The Godfather" films are also better than this (at least those movies also have coherent storylines, not just a smattering of f-bombs). Rated R for non-stop strong profanity strong incessant violence throughout, and brief nudity.<br /><br />This movie is not only too long for its own good, but is excessive on the violence, profanity (over 200 uses of the f-word and several other strong profanities, both in English and Spanish) and drug use (almost every scene shows Tony snorting cocaine). Plus, there's a gratutious scene of a naked woman. I have no problem with R-rated movies, but the excesses here are just too much for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Influential? How is this trash influential? This movie is disgusting..picture Grand Theft Auto turned movie. Yeah..now for those of you who'd like that..seeing drug dealers cussing a billion times and killing each other, then check this "classic" out.<br /><br />This movie is a story of drugs and violence. Now add this to that idea. This movie has nonstop violence, blood and guts and the dialogue is very original. It compromises of the F word and forced Cuban accents. What else? There's people selling drugs..using drugs...going crazy because of drugs..everything drugs.<br /><br />Now what about this movie is influential? This movie is so ridiculous that it is incomprehendable on televison. Why? Because all they say in the dialogue is stuff like this:<br /><br />You got the F'in coke, you F'in F'er?<br /><br />No, F you your mother F'er<br /><br />Man, I cut your F'in face up with my F'in chainsaw you F'in piece of F'in s#$%<br /><br />Wow! Now that's some quality dialogue. And the visuals are really great too. You see people getting hacked up by chainsaws and getting blown away by tommyguns and getting high off drugs. This movie isn't influential..oh sure maybe it is to the drug dealers out there but how is it influential to most people? How is it regarded as one of the best movies?<br /><br />This is absurd and seriously ridiculous. The dialogue is pathetic and Al Pacino's great acting skills are smuthered in F words. This movie is so "good" that it got this fancy DVD and is available at every store. Yet a wonderful movie like Malice is literally extinct.<br /><br />So, if you want to be like the rest of the world and watch this movie..then do it..and if you enjoy curse words and drugs and unnecessary violence...then you'll love this. Or if you love GTA and love running in the street hacking off people's arms..then definitely watch this.<br /><br />It's very disturbing that someone would like something like this and also very pathetic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I bought this film because I'm a fan of good gangster movies. There's no better way to understand how capitalism and the American Dream really works. I'd never seen Scarface and the reviews here made me feel I must be missing a classic. Nope. This really is unredeemably awful - and I could watch Al Pacino do cat food adverts he's that good. Brian de Palma, with a couple of exceptions, (Carlito's Way, The Untouchables), makes bloody awful films. This has a great cast, a mediocre script, truly bad direction and a soundtrack so awful that if you tried to pass it off as a pastiche of bad eighties music, it just wouldn't be plausible. I think my personal lowlights from this film come early on - the riot scene in the detention centre has no sense of menace or chaos, but consists entirely of dodgy looking extras standing on the spot, hopping from one foot to the other, waving sticks or bricks and grimacing unconvincingly. It's pathetic. And Tony Montana's first job in Miami is wonderful - he has to negotiate a deal with a Colombian coke dealer who's briefcase has two compartments - one for the coke, one for the chainsaw he uses to torture people. Isn't that fantastic? The shops must be full of stuff like that in Colombia, probably the only kind of equipment any self respecting dealer would travel with.... As for the final bloodbath - it is incredibly silly, but to get there you have to sit through two hours of a shapeless, boring tripe.

I mean, when all the shooting starts - let alone whether Pacino and his minions could operate with such blatant impunity - where were the cops?<br /><br />So what the story boils down to is:  bad guys rise and then fall.

Guaranteed, Scarface is an Al Pacino's picture. There are some great acting performances: Robert Loggia, Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, and Paul Shenar. But one very disappointing performance clearly goes to Michelle Pfeiffer who had no business being in that picture. I wish the story would have been constructed a lot better, given that it's from Oliver Stone, with a wishful helping hand from Francis Ford Coppola and/or Mario Puzio, perhaps Martin Scorsese. There is a point where Tony Montana was facing his own demise, but the problem is: what reason contributed to that? Also, I didn't see any more men beyond the bodyguards working for Tony Montana, let alone Frank Lopez. I need more depth in the story and in the development of the empire that Tony Montana had gained control of during his ascent to the top. Sadly, the picture robbed me of that. I really do hate being cheated by Brian De Palma, who is a somewhat gifted filmmaker, but his biggest problem is putting every aspect possible of the movie and making it all to work fluidly together. Pictures he had done come out so short of one thing or two each time: the wrong cast, the annoying camera movements, the falling-apart story, not enough developments, and so on. That's why he couldn't be revered in the same way as Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. Talent is there, but completeness, no. Scarface is more of a cult film than of a serious film. One great thing about Scarface is the conversations in the car, which are shot superbly well. All in all, Scarface is a mess of a film.<br /><br />9/11: Scarface was a ridiculous movie when it first premiered in 1983. Since then, it has steadily gained a lot of steam as being a more appreciated film to the point of achieving its cult status. Now, Scarface remains a very overrated flick. It's easily one of the most ridiculous mess of a spectacle. Personally, I found it to be one of the best comedies I've ever seen until it pretty much fell apart after two hours of mumbo jumbo. Two things are granted. One, Al Pacino makes a remarkable transformation from the days of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Godfather to this obscenely overacted performer that is Tony Montana. It's actually a fine performance, I have to say, despite the mess. Two, the cinematography is excellent throughout that keeps the film interesting to look at. I really enjoy the style, and of course, Brian De Palma is an expert in this area, as always. Naturally, Miami Vice the television show would soon later come and make an indelible mark on Miami. There is also a very, very similar but better stylized film called Manhunter that would rival Scarface for aesthetic quality, and the former wins the contest hands down. Let's go back to the mess, and analyze it a bit for a minute. The plot has the audience, believing that some immigrant from Cuba with obvious criminal past yet with zero connections can rise from the gutters to drug lord of Miami within mere months. Then, it all comes crashing down because he can't control his coke problem. So, the ending has to be done with a bang via Sam Peckinpah route. Looking at the cast, although young and just started out, sometimes I wonder if everybody is saying, "Are the director and the writer out of their minds?" repeatedly over and over throughout the filming. By looking at the end result, it sure looks like it. Anyone including me not buying Scarface for a second, they would all agree that Michelle Pfeiffer stunk up every scene she appears in. Then, we have to ask..."What did anyone ever see in her?" She has been a terrible actress for so many years, and it's almost impossible to think of a film that she was at least decent in. All in all, what a mess of a film. It would have been nice to see some realism and comprehensibility in Scarface. I am dropping the rating of the film from `7' to `5'.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I own the anniversary edition and I have seen the Platinum edition and I did not see that much of an improvement. They did add some sound effects, but it was not enough for me to buy another version of this movie. If you don't own the anniversay then buy the new one,but if you do own it, don't bother. The movie itself is excellent and one of Pacino's most famous and greatest roles. A excellent supporting cast and well written script round out one of the best gangster films of all time! The anniversary edition has an excellent transfer and some interesting extras.</p></br></body></html>
