(2) U.S. President Merkin Muffley, and (3) Dr. Strangelove himself. You will also no doubt recognize George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and a very young James Earl Jones.<br /><br />General Jack Ripper has gotten "a little funny," as President Muffley puts it, and gave the order for the Strategic Air Command (planes always in the air) for Plan R, which was intended to be the American response if the Soviets had blown up Washington and higher command (presuming including the President and the Joint Chiefs) were unavailable. A "disclaimer" at the beginning of the film states that the U.S. Air Force assures us all that it could not happen like this.<br /><br />Anyway, General Ripper not only set the planes carrying nuclear weapons to bomb Russia, he cut off all communication from his base to the outside world so that no one could countermand the order. Only he had the code which could recall the planes.<br /><br />Much of the action takes place in the Pentagon war room, where a huge map displays the paths of the SAC planes as they head for targets in Russia. I'd ruin half the fun of the humor if I told you too much, but suffice it to say that this movie puts forth the obvious fact that nobody -- not generals, not politicians, not anyone -- was prepared to cope with this kind of an emergency. Except Dr. Strangelove, of course. He has an idea for everything. Now if he can only remember to stop calling the president "mein fuhrer."<br /><br />One wrinkle occurs when the Soviet ambassador is called in and talks to the Premier on the hot line. He discovers that the Doomsday Bomb will be automatically triggered if any of these planes reach their targets.<br /><br />You wouldn't think the destruction of the world would be funny, would you? Still, when you hear General Ripper explain to Captain Lionel Mandrake why he did it ("our precious bodily fluids"), and then see Keenan Wynn soberly warn that if he obeys Captain Mandrake and shoots the lock off the Coke machine to get change for the pay phone so he can call the President, the Captain will have to "deal with the Coca Cola Company," you just can't help laughing. There are hundreds of laughs in this movie, just to show you that annihilation of the planets human and animal life is indeed a laughing matter.<br /><br />Try to believe the Air Force's disclaimer, and learn to stop worrying. After all, the Soviets are no more, so we don't have to worry about the bomb anymore, right? Isn't that right? Sure it is!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>...that this madness is over and that no paranoid politicians and insane military leaders can lead us into oblivion?<br />Kubrick's black comedy of 1964 about the cold war and the arms race is only 'outdated' at first glance. Ok, the cold war is over, most of it. Arms races are temporarily on hold, until further notice (after all, the opponents of deficit spending will never oppose a proper military budget, will they). But: just listen to insane General Jack D. Ripper's conspiracy theory about fluoride additives, or to General Turgidson's ravings about armament gaps in comparison to the Commies, and you will rather easily recognize their various contemporary brothers in arms. Either of them would stand a chance to win the reptiliannomination.<br /><br />By the way, there is a frequent misconception that Peter Sellers plays the madman in this film. Not so. Sellers plays some of the rational people here (the RAF officer who tries to stop the Ripper, and the President). He also plays the clown, Strangelove, Merkwuerdigliebe, an amalgam of all hijacked Nazi scientists. He is just crazy. Harmless.<br />Brilliant acting by Sellers in his 3 parts, and by George C.Scott as Turgidson (who is said to have been unhappy with his character.)<br />Worth a repeat visit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Hilarious black comedy from the master, Stanley Kubrick, spoofing & really making a statement out of the cold war & the USA's anal paranoia of Communist take over. Still holds up fantastic today! Got to love the nuclear bomb riding Slim Pickens! What a classic scene!<br /><br /> Peter Sellers is at his best portraying three very different characters! His Dr. Strangelove has to go down as a comedic performance of the 20th century! A true masterpiece!<br /><br />Communism will never be the same! Neither will Capitalism!<br /><br />"No fighting in the war room!" LOL!</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>This is a case where the parts are greater than the whole. Taken altogether, Dr. Strangelove is a good movie that doesn't quite seem to come together. The parts, though; the distinct segments that make up the movie; the masterful cinematography that captures the characters and sets in ways that beautifully heighten their essences; the sexual underpinnings of the most powerful character motivations; the all around great performances including Peter Sellers' triple roles and, most impressive of all, George C. Scott's Buck Turgidson which is so animated, so expressive, and so thoroughly committed that, while it hovers just shy of Sellers' delightfully cartoonish Dr. Strangelove, it remains completely believable. These are what make the film a must see for anyone who loves comedy or good filmmaking, or great acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>What kind of movie. Brilliant, demential, cynical, dynamical, perfect, ironical with a dazzling script, excellent camara direction and a superb cast.<br />If not for Kind hearts and cornets (1950) this would be the greatest black comedy ever made.<br />Kubrick broke all the previous forecast and established this film like an authentical landmark.<br />Sellers in his best triple performance.  George C Scott and Sterling Hyden are really amazing.<br />A MASTERPIECE.<br />What are you waiting for acquiring it?<br />Mein f&uuml;hrer I can walk!</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>There is one apparent similarity between all of Stanley Kubrick&#65533;s films, and that is everyone of them is very different then the rest. Dr. Strangelove is no exception as his only comedy, and it works on nearly every level.<p>Dr. Strangelove is considered by many as one of his best works. While I don&#65533;t necessarily place it as high on that list, it is still an excellent dark comedic look at nuclear threat. The story jumps back and forth between a number of characters as an insane general gives his planes orders to drop nukes on the Soviet Union in an unprovoked attack while the rest of the nation scrambles to put a stop to it. <p>Probably the most apparent success in this film is the excellent acting by Peter Sellers in three different roles (the president, a British officer, and the eccentric Dr. Strangelove), as well as wonderful performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens and the rest of the cast. Sellers nails each of his characters, adding much of their comedic wit. Many of his funniest lines were improved, such as a hilarious phone call to the drunken Russian president. Kubrick managed to bring out top-notch acting all around here. Also, the fantastic sets are amazing, especially the gigantic War Room set comprised of a gigantic round table and three huge panels depicting the world looming over it. Kubrick shows his photographic roots as well in the stunning cinematography of many of his scenes. Characters and objects are juxtaposed in visually pleasing and symbolic ways, and often reveal visual gags.<p>Much of the humor, as is often the case with black comedy, is easily missed if your not paying attention. In fact, this film definitely favors repeat viewings. Each time I watch it, I notice a few more jokes hidden throughout the film. But the suspense also builds along with the humor as the world&#65533;s situation becomes more and more desperate.<p>The only flaws in Dr. Strangelove seem to be its slow beginning which doesn&#65533;t offer much humor, and a few minor production value problems such as jump cuts and poor audio transitions, most of which can be contributed to filmmaking conditions of the time.<p>This is definitly worth checking out if you like black comedies, or love the visual and symbolic style of Kubrick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>....and great acting too!!<br />This movie has it all and does it all.  The acting is incredibly good.  The storyline is crisp and direct, and grabs your attention literally by the throat and never lets go.  The ending will do much more than rattle you.  It rocks!<p>A US Air Force general, on his own authority, has decided to order his planes to attack the old Soviet Union.  His notion is brutally simple:  he reasons that in order to prevent a devastating counterattack, the US will have no choice but to follow his lead and launch a full attack upon the Russian military.  Well, you know that that doesn't happen.  What does happen is pretty unforgettable.  By the way, this is not a "fail-safe" ripoff.  These are two very different movies and themes, albeit they share a single common idea--that "the bomb" might get out of control.<p>This movie has everything.  It manages to present a serious theme seriously, but the humor which punctuates this film like bullets is absolutely hysterically funny.  And if you don't think so, there is something wrong with the purity of your own bodily ... fluids.  (See the flick and you'll know what I mean.)<p>The sense of reality and authenticity of this Stanley Kubrick film is incredible.  When you are up with the B-52s, you KNOW that this is a real B-52. When US infantry goes into action, you KNOW it is the real thing.  This is another black-and-white flick that benefits from this medium.<p>This is a DVD that you'll want to own and watch many times.  It is unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed dark comedy about nuclear holocaust is among  the greatest film satires ever produced.  To truly appreciate this film it  is necessary to remember its historical context.  It was produced right  after President Kennedy was assassinated and just two years after the Cuban  Missile Crisis.  The whole world was gripped with a profound paranoia about  nuclear annihilation.  Average Americans were spending their life savings  to build bomb shelters in their basements.<p>A strong anti nuke sentiment  was building in the U.S. and anti-nuke protests abounded.  This film was  one of two anti-nuke movies made in 1964.  The other was "Fail Safe"  starring Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau which was a heavy handed drama that  depicted an accidental breakdown of the Fail Safe system that resulted in a  nuclear attack on Russia.  "Fail Safe" conveyed its anti war message  through a realistic dramatization of an accidental war that frightened the  most cavalier of viewers.  "Strangelove" accomplished its purpose through  brilliant satire, turning strident generals and politicians into absurd  caricatures.  The dire nature of the topic at a time when real fear was at  its height produced a catharsis that made this film even funnier when it  was first released than it is today.<p>Kubrick's direction was nothing  short of genius.  The film is laced with so many subtle innuendoes and  ironies; one could see it twenty times and still not find them all.  For  instance, most of the names had sexual connotations.  Strangelove  (perversion), Mandrake (a root to used to promote conception), Merkin  (slang for female genitalia) Muffley (same), Buck (stud) Turgidson  (distended with swelling).  The battle to take over the air force complex  took place with a sign that said, "Peace Is Our Profession" in the  background.  Then there is President Muffley's great line, "You can't fight  in here, this is the War Room!"<p>The entire ensemble gave superlative  performances.  Peter Sellers was marvelous playing three parts.  As the  President, he was deadpan and serious while delivering one hilarious line  after another.  As Mandrake, he was the gentlemanly Brit trying nervously  to reason with a madman.  Finally, his best performance was as Dr.  Strangelove, a crippled immigrant German scientist who kept inadvertently  calling the President, "Mein Fuhrer".  This was Sellers at his zaniest, and  it was some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen.<p>George C. Scott  was perfect as the gung ho war hawk.  He brayed, strutted, and played the  butt kicking military man to the hilt and beyond.  This part was a  harbinger of his most famous role as Patton, where he played essentially  the same character without the tongue in cheek embellishments.  And who can  forget Slim Pickens, who is shown on the cover of the video box riding the  nuke to ground zero in one of the funniest and most famous scenes in the  history of film.<p>This is one of the most creative, witty and effective  lampoons ever done.  It makes its point effectively by poking fun at people  who take themselves all too seriously, and by making us laugh at that of  which we are most afraid.  I rated it a perfect 10.  "AAAAAHooooo!"</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>One of the funniest movies ever made. Although the subject matter is nothing to laugh about, it manages to get a laugh in every scene. Peter Sellers gives one of the best comedy performances of the century playing 3  different roles (Kubrick and Sellers had originally planned for him to play  4 roles). George C. Scott is extremely funny as the eccentric general,  Sterling Hayden is also great as the general who is obsessed with bodily  fluids. Great craftsmanship courtesy of Kubrick. One of the all-time  greats, extremely entertaining and grows funnier with each viewing. Extras:  spot James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader). From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"In the days after it first opened in early 1964, Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" took on the enchanted aura of a film that had gotten away with something. Johnson was in the White House, the Republicans were grooming Goldwater, both sides took the Cold War with grim solemnity, and the world was learning to be comfortable with the term "nuclear deterrent." Roger Ebert<br /><br />I purchased the 40th Anniversary CD and this is my third or forth viewing, but "Dr. Strangelove" seems fresh and undated - an irreverant satire. The willingness of the Director to follow the film to its conclusion - nuclear annihilation -  has that special touch  Its black and white photography is in particular important for its portrayal.<br /><br />General Ripper orders the B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. When the British military attache, Peter Sellers, tries to stop him, Ripper explains the plot to "taint our water supply and deplete our "precious bodily fluids."  He won't even discuss the re-call code. Eventually, he realizes he will be caught and he ends his game. Events on the Army Base are mixed with the War Room in the Pentagon. President Muffley learns from Dr Strangelove and the Doomsday Machine. It appears that neither the Doomsday Machine nor one of the U.S. bombers can be turned from their missions.<br /><br />"The movie's screenplay, by Terry Southern turn this scenario into a dark comedy of errors, illuminated by flashes of brilliant satire. Some of the dialogue has entered the language - "precious bodily fluids," of course, and also the way the dim-witted Col. Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) hints darkly of Commie "preverts." The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British attache, who does not have the correct small change to call the White House and save the world, is one of the movie's best-constructed gags." Roger Ebert<br /><br />The acting in this film is superb, in fact it would be very difficult to top this crew. Sterling Hayden is the epitome of a paranoiac Gen. Ripper.  George C. Scott, however, steals the movie and is brilliant as, Gen. Buck Turgidson, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And Peter Sellers, as President, as Dr Strangelove and RAF Group Captain Mandrake h portrays the epitome of humor, satire and acting. Maj. "King" Kong (Slim Pickens), is perfect in the role of the pilot. His exit from the movie, riding a bomb like a bronco, remains one of the most famous moments in modern film, and is my favorite scene from the movie.<br /><br />"When you consider the history of motion pictures, certain watershed films leap to min. Without a doubt, one of those is Stanley Kubrik's 1964 masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove. As political satire, few movies -- even those as incisive as the hilariously vicious 1992 release Bob Roberts -- come close to this level of accomplishment. In the case of Dr. Strangelove, the barbs and quips (both subtle and obvious) hold up as well today as they did thirty years ago." Bosley Crowther<br /><br />This film shows that it is possible to laugh and to laugh continuously at a shocker of a film that is filled with satire.  It is only when Slim Pickens is riding the bomb do we realizae that this could be real. There But For The Grace Of God, Go We.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-0507<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0RR62">2001 - A Space Odyssey [HD DVD</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVI8GU">A Clockwork Orange</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056WRD">Being There</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVS2">Patton</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z4OXS">Blazing Saddles (30th Anniversary Special Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>There's little I can add to the glowing reviews of this movie that have already been posted.  It really is a classic, hilarious in a very dark way, and eminently watchable 40 years after it was made.  Rating the movie, as a movie, I'd give it 5 stars without hesitation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the print they used to make the DVD - I have the Special Edition, not the 40th Anniversary set - is less than perfect. There are lots of little speckles and flecks that are clearly on the print and not the result of digitizing the images. You'd think they would have either found a better print or cleaned up the one they used; it's not hard to do cleanup on a black-and-white print.<br /><br />That said, the photography is often great. The close-ups of Sterling Hayden are masterful, and the War Room appears totally real.  The only place where it's obvious that they're using composite shots is when you see the B-52 flying over the Arctic landscape.<br /><br />So, while I love this movie, I have to dock it a point for the poor print. If I could give this DVD 4.5 stars I would, but there's no provision for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8GXSCB1R05T.html">A2B8GXSCB1R05T</a><br/><p>Ask someone who knows movies to give you a list of the great comedies, and you can be sure that "Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" will come up in the top five at least.

It makes perfect sense then, that the folks at Sony-Columbia have re-released this movie on DVD (this is its third incarnation). However, for folks who bought the excellent special edition released three years ago, is it really worth the upgrade?<br /><br />One of the new extras on this 2-DVD set is "No Fighting in the War Room or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat," an impressive 30-minute documentary that examines the social and political conditions that inspired and helped shape the film.<br /><br />"Inside Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" is an excellent, in-depth 46-minute documentary on the making of Kubrick's masterpiece. This is a fascinating look at how Strangelove came to be with lots of information and eye-witness accounts from the cast and crew that are still alive.<br /><br />"Best Sellers or: Peter Sellers and Dr. Strangelove" is another new addition and examines the comedic genius of this talented actor. Shirley MacLaine, Roger Ebert and Michael Palin gush about Sellers but the real treat here is rare, vintage home movie footage of the young comedian honing his craft.<br /><br />"The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove" is a solid profile of Kubrick from his humble beginnings as photographer in New York City to his work on Strangelove. This is a very well done overview of Kubrick's early career but those hungry for more should really check out the superb feature-length documentary on the Kubrick box set.<br /><br />Another new extra is "An Interview with Robert McNamara" that runs 24 minutes. He talks at length about the real people and events that informed Kubrick's film. McNamara comes off as a little dry at this length and was more palatable in the digestible soundbites on the other extras.<br /><br />There is also "Split Screen Interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott" that were done on the set of Strangelove for promotional purposes.<br /><br />Finally, there is a "Theatrical Advertising Gallery," which showcases the provocative ad campaign for the movie at the time.<br /><br />Dr. Strangelove is a nightmare comedy about annihilation. For the satire of the film to work, we must be distanced from the seriousness of the subject. In effect, by the film's end, we have learned to "love the bomb" as the film's title suggests, by giving into the comic, satirical nature of the movie. Kubrick's film is eerily relevant now because much of what he was mocking still exists. President George W. Bush is a mixture of the gung-ho, might-make-right of General Ripper and the cowboy antics of Major Kong, with the bumbling incompetence of President Muffley. The new extra material is quite good but not really worth double-dipping unless you are a dedicated fan of this movie. However, for newcomers, this is the version to get.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>One of the most interesting films of all time, Dr Strangelove is a farcical look at the insane underpinnings of some of the Cold War theories regarding Mutual Assured Destruction. With the Soviet Union and the United States threatening to utilize the tools of nuclear war (sanity began to sink in following the Cuban Missile Crisis) - each to prevent the other from dominating his realm - a brilliant satire on the situation was inevitable. Highly regarded director Stanley Kubrick (of A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey) rose to the challenge. Despite the four decades which have passed since the release of Dr Strangelove, the film retains its place as a masterpiece of social commentary. And regardless of one's political ideology, Dr Strangelove is outrageously funny...<br /><br />Gathering a collection of oddball kooks, paranoid wackos, and outright insane individuals, the characters in Dr Strangelove bring the world to the very edge of destruction - without batting an eye, and all the while inexplicably protecting their petty fiefdoms from the greedy hands of their perceived enemies. After all, what if some bombs are left over after the nuclear war and the other side uses them to strike at our cave dwellings - to seize our caves!!!! In short, Dr Strangelove is a film beyond description. One just has to see it for himself...<br /><br />When U.S. Air Force Colonel Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely insane, believing the communists are conspiring to poison the 'bodily fluids' of the American populace, he orders his squadrons to attack the U.S.S.R. and drop a payload of nuclear bombs. The lone renegade sparks U.S. military action against his stronghold and a top level meeting between US President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and his top advisors. Conversing with Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky (Peter Bull), the president tries to put an end to the crisis and avert nuclear war. But he learns instead that a nuclear strike by the US would automatically trigger a Soviet 'Doomsday' machine which will destroy all known life on Earth.<br /><br />Desperate to save the world, the president must deal with a drunken Soviet Premier, the warmonger General 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott), and listen to the droning monologues of former Nazi-scientist, turned genius advisor, Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). Sellers is hilarious in this role as well as his others. Overall, this movie is a hilarious series of laughs with an endless number of one-liners such as "Gentleman, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!"<br /><br />Hilarious to the end, Dr Strangelove is a modern satire that would make Jonathan Swift proud. Nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture, Dr Strangelove nevertheless went home from the Oscars empty handed. But the picture's legacy only seems to grow with the passing of time. Standout, Oscar-worthy performances by Peter Sellers and George C. Scott strengthen every aspect of the film, and the end of the Cold War only witnessed the rise of a new war against Islamic terrorism - with some similarly ridiculous ideas emanating from Washington's power brokers... Overall, this is a funny movie that puts the world political stage back in perspective. Its enduring success makes Dr. Strangelove a definite must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's classic 1964 satire on militarism and the Cold War specifically. So close to the reality of the time that the humor of the movie lies more in how closely it reflects the political and military thinking of the Cold War: hence the satire.<br /><br />Sterling Hayden delivers an impeccable performance as General Jack D. Ripper, the psychotically paranoid Air Force general who orders a preemptive nuclear strike by a B-52 squadron on the U.S.S.R. Peter Sellers is brilliant in his triple role as the U.S. President, Dr. Strangelove, and Mandrake. George C. Scott also tops the cake in his over-the-top caricature of the Pattonesque General Buck Turgidson. It's hard to describe all of the nuances of this film on such a short review: you have to see it for yourself. Although the film will certainly have more of an impact on those who are old enough to remember the Cold War and all its tensions: there's a universal message in this satire that isn't bound to just that period of time.<br /><br />As a side note, this film isn't far from the truth as the Soviets had, by 1964, indeed developed a doomsday device. Under Stalin's rule, the USSR was planning to dock several grounded tanker ships filled to the decks with nuclear material. The ships would automatically detonate and consume the earth in radiation once they detected a level of radiation that could only be present as a result of nuclear war. Horrified by the possibility of accidents and human error, Nikita Kruskev ordered the project scrapped and it was never implemented.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's satire of the cold-war gone berserk was being made at about the same time (1964) as the &quot;serious&quot; treatment of the same theme by the movie &quot;Fail Safe&quot; starring Henry Fonda (also very good).<p>Shot in black-and-white, frequently in wide-angle for extended periods of time, there are many unforgettable images - probably the most-remembered of which is Major Kong (played by normally-a-cowboy actor Slim Pickens) riding the dropping bomb - &quot;Yee-haw...yee-hawwww!&quot;.<p>Although much has been made of Peter Sellers' 3 roles (which would have been four (as Major Kong) if not for breaking his ankle), I think Geroge C. Scott should have gotten an oscar for his performance. His &quot;itemization&quot; scene in the war-room was a thing of beauty - the single best part is when he gets to &quot;five...&quot;. Later, he also accidently (as rumor has it) falls down and somersaults to his feet, still delivering his line - and Kubrick decided to use it.<p>Sterling Hayden (normally a cowboy actor) also could have gotten an oscar for his performance as Jack D. Ripper, the Burpleson air force base commander who sends the planes against Russia. The scene when he tells Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) about his plan is probably the best single scene overall in the movie, except for...<p>Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove at the end. He plays his German scientist role way way over the top. (&quot;Animals could be bred und slaughtered!&quot;). I won't spoil it further, however. Balances nicely with his portrayal of Group Captain Mandrake on loan from the RAF (&quot;Shoot, with the gun! That's what the bullets are for, you twit!&quot;), and his rather meek president Mertin Muffley (&quot;Get me Premiere Kissoff!&quot;).<p>James Earl Jones and Keenan Wynn have minor roles.<p>The one funky thing is the obvious fake flying bomber shots - a static model with rear-projection - but it is almost surely intentionally hokey.

There are also later editions with a different mix of goodies. Many DVD's contain what they call extras (I call them Goodies). In a lot of cases they are just rehashed versions of the movie or just rattling. In this case the extra "Inside the Making of DR.STRAINGLOVE" rivals the movie itself for entertainment and useful content. You find out how the movie evolved from a serious piece to a serious black comedy. You find that the movie is an aggregate of many talented people. It would take too log to describe the details that motivated the movie so you will just have to purchase this edition.<br /><br />There is also a trailer for "Fail Safe" a rival movie on the special edition.<br />Dame Vera Lynn "We'll Meet Again" (1942)<br /><br />We'll Meet Again<br /><br /> We'll meet again,<br /> Don't know where,<br /> Don't know when,<br /> But I know<br /> We'll meet again<br /> Some sunny day.<br /><br /> Keep smiling through<br /> Just like you<br /> Always do<br /> Till the blue skies<br /> Drive the dark clouds<br /> Far away.<br /><br /> So will you please<br /> Say hello<br /> To the folks<br /> That I know<br /> Tell them,<br /> I won't be long.<br /><br /> They'll be happy to<br /> know<br /> That as you saw me go<br /> I was singing this song.<br /><br />One part I found interesting was when the Air crew was examining their survival kit.

Although the subject matter is nothing to laugh about, it manages to get a laugh in every scene. Peter Sellers gives one of the best comedy performances of the century playing 3  different roles (Kubrick and Sellers had originally planned for him to play  4 roles). George C. Scott is extremely funny as the eccentric general,  Sterling Hayden is also great as the general who is obsessed with bodily  fluids. Great craftsmanship courtesy of Kubrick. One of the all-time  greats, extremely entertaining and grows funnier with each viewing. Extras:  spot James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader).

The opening credits (An in-flight refueling of a B-52 and KC-135), is the parody of a porno flick, right down to the use of the theme "Try a little tenderness". The names of the targets assigned to the B-52 crew include Laputa (The fictional kingdom in Gulliver's Travels, though I haven't read the book) and Coatloss (Self-explanatory). The battle for Burpelson Air Force Base is waged in front of a sign with the SAC motto "Peace is our Profession" on it. Also, funny are General "Buck" Turgidson's lines ("I think we should hold off judgment until the facts are in", "It's not fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip-up!", "General Ripper has already invalidated that policy!", "It appears that General Ripper has exceeded his authority" "Gee I wish we had one of them Doomsday machines!"). <p>Then of course, there are some memorable scenes that must not be forgotten.  The phone call between wimpy President Merkin Muffely and Soviet Premier Kissoff ("A man of the people, but also a man..."), General Ripper's obsession with purity of essence and our natural fluids, Colonel Bat Guano's obsession with deviated preverts, the survival-kit contents check (Which includes chewing gum, lipsticks, nylon-stockings and a miniature Russian phrase book/bible), Major Kong's riding of the Hydrogen Bomb to oblivion and Dr. Strangelove describing the 10 females for every male ratio in the underground mineshafts, the Doctor exclaiming "There'd be much time and little to do". Then the Doomsday machine goes off to the happy themes of Vera Lynn's "We'll meet again". <p>Okay, so I just gave away half the plot. But I have watched this film 100 million times and I still like it. You will too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick was a director of many faces. His films always had that distinctive look. His films dealt with the consequences of war (Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory), human evolution & alien intelligence (2001: A Space Odyssey), a descent into madness (The Shining), and an analysis on humanity & free will (A Clockwork Orange). While most of his films are based off of novels from Stephen King, Anthony Burgess, and others, Kubrick mostly moved away from the primary sources and put his own artistic qualities into them. Out of all the novels, I have read only "A Clockwork Orange" (which is ironic since I've never seen the film just yet, but I hope to see it as soon as possible), and judging from author's reactions (the most obvious being Stephen King), it's quite clear that Kubrick had a different vision with each of the novels that he adapted onto the big screen. With Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb, it's yet another loose adaptation, but I'm not here to complain about the director's calculated and eccentric process.<br /><br />Inspired by the novel "Red Alert" by Peter George, this black comedy was created in 1964, and was seen as a daring attempt to bring humor into the thought of a nuclear war. Knowing that this film was made in the middle of the Cold War, it's even funnier forty-five years later. This is not toilet humor. This is dark political humor that's incredibly ironic and satirical. There are so many classic scenes ("Be careful, Mr. President. I think he's drunk."), that it's simply hard to describe all of them in just one review. Straight to the point, this is one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films, and one of the greatest comedies of all time. It has a great ensemble of actors (Sellers, Scott, and Pickens steal the show), a bold script, amazing black-and-white cinematography, and, as I've mentioned earlier, numerous memorable scenes. Now granted, this film isn't for everybody. Those who are not into politics may not be interested, but those who are willing to see a 60's black comedy that's fantastically modern would no doubt find this one entertaining.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>I must have seen this "black comedy" at least one- half dozen times and, unfortunately, it gets less funny for me every time.  The United States was just beginning to accelerate its Vietnam troop strength in 1964, and at age 16, living in suburban Boston, the title of the movie was quickly changed to "Dr. Strangeglove" in honor of Red Sox bumbler Dick Stuart. I distinctly remember Strangelove's performance as being hilarious, and still do, simply because he's totally, totally  unrealistic.It's the other characters, especially the base commander, the President, George C. Scott, et al who have become more realistic over the years, therefore more scary to me. Remember, in 2007, the United States flew nuclear weapons right down the center of the country, leaving them unattended on a Texas airbase,This morning's Presidential budget includes $70 billion in new defense spending; this despite various sundry plans to "wind down' overseas. For years, historical novelist Gore Vidal, now living in Italy, has been harping that money and sex are the true powers in Washington D.C. Care to debate him? In summary, Strangelove the character will always be a personal favorite. As for the movie, it becomes more prophetic, less comedic, more black, with every wiewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_ (1964) is a darkly comic and disturbing film directed by Stanley Kubrick.  The film is regarded by many as one of the greatest classics of all time and satirizes the ludicrousness of such notions as Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.) and the horrors of nuclear war.  The film was made during the height of Cold War hysteria and shows the sheer lunacy and idiocy of the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in their attempts to build ever greater weapons of mass destruction.  The film also shows the lunacy of scientists and generals who operate behind the scenes and plan to unleash these weapons upon an unwitting populace.  The film is meant to be a black comedy and thus features many absurd components which serve only to re-inforce in the mind of the viewer the horrible matters being presented in such a light-hearted manner.<br /><br />The movie begins with the lunacy of General Jack D. Ripper, who believes in a communist conspiracy to destroy the "bodily fluids" of the American people through fluoridated water.  Ripper decides to strike the Soviet Union with a nuclear attack and manages to do so without the authorization of the president by making use of a special emergency plan known as "Plan R".  The film then focuses on the men flying the plane which is set on unleashing this weapon upon the Russians, showing the conflicts that develop between them.  The film also features Peter Sellers playing Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, who serves as an important executive under General Ripper and tries to dissuade him from the attack.  The film then focuses on a special meeting of the president and his generals in the "War Room".  (One particularly humorous and memorable line from the movie occurs when the president makes the comment to one of his generals and the Russian ambassador that there is to be "no fighting in the War Room".)  The president notifies the Russians of the attack in an effort to thwart the attack and thus prevent a full scale and destructive nuclear war through the Russian ambassador.  Unfortunately, as it turns out, the Soviets have devised a "doomsday device" which upon the destruction of their own missiles will completely obliterate all life on earth.  Thus, the president must attempt to call back the U.S. aircraft which plan on unleashing this destruction before it is too late.  The film also features Peter Sellers as the Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove who periodically alternates between giving the Nazi salute and addressing the president as "Mein Furher" and "Mein President".  Dr. Strangelove explains to the president how the doomsday device is to work and also offers up the possibility of an escape by a few selected people who will live under the earth in mines.  It should be pointed out that Dr. Strangelove is believed to be an amalgamation of the ex-Nazi scientist Werner von Braun and Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb.  The film ends in a very disturbing manner as this terror is unleashed upon the world.<br /><br />This film remains an essential classic and is ranked by many as among the greatest of all times.  The message of the film is quite disturbing in that it shows how mass lunacy may break out and a nuclear war result.  Through the actions of madmen within the United States military and government, a nuclear war is made inevitable.  For those who lived under constant threat of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, such a possibility was a distinct reality.  Thus, while the film attempts to make light of this issue, underlying this humor is an all-too-disturbing reality.  This film is to be highly recommended to all thoughtful people who struggle with the notion that individuals in power continue to wield weapons of mass destruction and that they may be unleashed upon nations at any time.  While the Cold War is supposedly over, such weapons still exist and their reality remains all-too-apparent.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" is an old movie that tackles a difficult subject, the end of the world as we know it due to a nuclear war. Despite that, it is simply brilliant, and not boring at all.<br /><br />Why? Well, there are different reasons to say that, but I think I'll point out only those that I deem more important:<br /><br />1- To start with, even though this film was made in 1964, director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a timeless masterpiece that depicts, in a sardonic way, the dangers of nuclear war. The message of this movie still comes across as valid, albeit nowadays for different reasons.<br /><br />2- Secondly, even though the subject is undeniably serious, this movie is a black comedy that makes you laugh. If that is difficult to believe, take into account that the plot involves a crazy general (Sterling Hayden) that sidesteps the chain of command in order to launch a nuclear airstrike on the URSS, something his aide (Captain Mandrake, played by Peter Sellers), the President (played by Peter Sellers!!) and many of his advisors (including Dr. Strangelove, a scientist also played by Peter Sellers) try to stop. But will that be possible? And what about the Soviet "Doomsday Machine", that will be triggered automatically by any nuclear attack on Soviet soil?<br /><br />All in all, I think this is the kind of movie you simply must watch. Highly recommended  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Talk about nuclear proliferation -- "Dr. Strangelove" is back on DVD, making its fifth appearance in that video format's relatively short life. This "40th Anniversary Special Edition" of Stanley Kubrick's blackest of black comedies targets households bunkered for the widescreen age. The primary upgrades are the high-definition transfer (its first) and -- more dramatically -- a re-engineering into 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen.<br /><br />Aspect ratios usually don't draw attention, but "Strangelove" is a special and controversial case. The previous Columbia DVD, released in 2001 (included in Warner Bros.' "Stanley Kubrick Collection"), followed specs issued by the director. Kubrick's home-vid vision -- presumably influenced by VHS and the square TVs that still dominated in the 1990s -- was mostly full screen (1.33:1) with some slight ratio adjustments. Criterion's marvelous laserdisc of 1992 shifted between 1.66 and 1.33, again per Kubrick.<br /><br />Columbia's latest thinking was to redeploy "Strangelove" in its "correct" original British theatrical widescreen ratio of 1.66, providing consistent dimensions scene-to-scene as in 1964. A direct comparison of the 2001 DVD and the new disc reveals a lot of lost visual information, some significant. The effect on compositions inside on Ken Adam's famed War Room set ranges from meaningless to dramatic when A-B'd. The transfer holds other surprises. The new version is markedly darker at the expense of imagery previously much more brightly cast. The older versions tended toward coarse, blown-out contrasts, however, and many viewers will appreciate the new more elegant and sinister look. Sony's restorers were able to exterminate a lot of the debris evident on the older DVD, even though they used materials several generations away from the mother negative (the original is long gone).<br /><br />Audio options are Dolby Digital, DTS and mono, all solid choices, but don't expect much from the 40-year-old sound. (Kubrick wanted you to hear it in mono.) The 5.1 formats add some rear-channel rattle and hum from the bombers and some echoes, but the sound mostly holds its center-channel position. All that great dialogue from Kubrick and Terry Southern is crystal clear, an upgrade from the 2001 version, which sounds a bit hollow.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>I have recently seen Dr Strangelove for the first time, and know it is one of those rare movies that will compel multiple viewings. Peter Sellers plays a tour de force triumverate: as abashed President Merkin Muffley, stiff upper lip Group Captain Lionel Mandrake and the mad wild Dr Strangelove. He displays the full range of his comic talent. The plot, turns into a slick, Catch 22 style satire on the bad zaniness of war and human motivation and races in increasingly powerful circles towards the conclusion. There are multiple brilliant comic set pieces to be savoured over and over.<br /><br />Highly recommended as satire of the highest order on the paranoid 1960s. And with the declaration a few years ago by a Commander in the Indian Army that they could afford a complete exchange of nuclear weapons with Pakistan at an estimated loss of only 16 million people, the logic of Strangelove may hang over us a while longer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Dr. Strangelove, like most black comedy, finds its humor in the fact that there is really very little humor to be found in the situation it presents.<br /><br />Mankind, in trying to secure peace (through Mutally Assured Destruction-type nuclear deterrence), manages to completely bungle every step, accidentally dropping a hydrogen bomb and causing the triggering of a Doomsday Device which will force us to live in caves for a hundred years.<br /><br />What's funny about that? Nothing. And, of course, everything.<br /><br />The funny thing about it is that it's so true--humanity really is that inept and bumbling; we really could "oops" our way into a nuclear winter--and we're left with the options of laugh about it or give up in despair. Movies like Dr. Strangelove allow us to see the ridiculousness that we continually create and "find the funny" rather than anguish.<br /><br />Specifically, we're shown the hyper-paranoid mentality of the Cold War, with all of its suffocating rules and fail-safes (with the eventual result that no one is able to call back the planes sent to bomb Russia, because no one has the proper authorization). Hilariously, though, we're shown that the paranoia has a *basis*, as the Russian Ambassador snaps spy-photos of "the Big Board" when the Doomsday Device has already been triggered and surely such espionage has lost all meaning. We're shown how our well-meaning public officials (represented by the President) are at the mercy of testosterone-fueled, cereberally-challenged Generals and insane scientists culled from Hitler's government (with the Nazi inside always threatening to come out).<br /><br />Dr. Strangelove, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War and nuclear arms race, shows how humanity, in everything it does or tries to do, always manages to muck things up in the most hideously, and appropriately, ironic of ways. ("Peace Is Our Profession" read the signs of the Air Force Base, as the gunfire rings out and the bombers fly towards their targets.) Dr. Strangelove tells us to accept all of this, smile, and "stop worrying."<br /><br />Beyond the general purpose of black comedy, and Dr. Strangelove's particular topic, this is a wonderful film. Brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed. Peter Sellers is, as you think he might be, a stand-out, wonderful in all three of his roles (and the first two times I watched this movie, I couldn't even tell that all three were the same man), and so is George C. Scott and the rest of the supporting cast.<br /><br />This is my favorite of Kubrick's collection and my favorite black comedy.<br /><br />As one final note for this five-star comedy, I wonder if Dr. Strangelove will, over time, lose its appeal to the newer generations. They will not have grown up during the Cold War, and they will have missed out on that era's particular fear of and obsession with The Bomb. Perhaps, if Dr. Strangelove loses its relevance and appeal to succeeding generations, that will be a good thing and signal progress? We can only hope for the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Naturally from an acting point of view Peter Sellers dominates this film. Playing three roles: The RAF Captain, US President Muffley and Dr Stranglove. Each is a comedic performance of brilliance. The RAF Captain is the voice of sanity to Sterling Haydens's mad US General. Its more than just a funny performance, Sellers acting portrays a desperation in his dealings with Gen Jack D Ripper. Having said that Sellers dominates, don't think this is one-man show. Both Sterling Hayden and George C Scott give stand-out performances.<br /><br />The film is full of great visual gags and some wonderful one-liners. "No fighting in the war room" being a favourite of mine.<br /><br />The film satarises the cold war paranoia of the 60's and was made soon after the Cuban missile crisis.<br /><br />Of course we mustn't forget the mastermind behind the film - Stanley Kubrick. He directed and co-wrote the film. In some of the brief attack scenes on the airbase you can see how he would later shoot Full Metal Jacket. It is an endlessly watchable film that any sane person will want to own!</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie is really the definitive dark comedy, there is nothing particulary funny about nukes or war for that matter, but this film does indeed make you laugh. Peter Sellers was one of the best comedic talents who ever lived. Dr. Strangelove displays his talents in one film just as well as the entire Pink Panther series did. Stanley Kubrick was a great director and this movie is one of his finest works. Highly recommended movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>Like these separate threads that just somehow crossed at this moment...<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick was a serious director.  He had never made a comedy before.  His mastery of film was forged by his doing every single job in making little movies (and then REALLY BIG movies, like "Spartacus"), but especially his forte - cinematography.  He's a visual director, before and after this movie, and then tackles a talking head project...<br /><br />Peter Sellers was, by this time, reknowned for being a mimic and a great comic satirist.  And he'll advance that reputation beyond all measure here.<br /><br />George C. Scott gets top billing.  At the time of this movie, he was playing a dead-earnest social worker on an American TV show called "East Side/West Side."  To become a dissolute, crazed American general was breaking with type.<br /><br />Read the stories here about Slim Pickens and watch the film.  Do you believe that he did not know he was doing a satire?  I can't accept that.  It's a funny idea, though.<br /><br />Sterling Hayden?  Well, learn about his personal life before and after this movie.  He's a damn scary guy.<br /><br />But, getting back to Kubrick, notice the way the movie is lit.  Kubrick is reknowned for his cinematography and his meticulous nature.  For example, he might have been the only director who asked "A-list" actors to be present while lighting adjustments were made, versus getting stand-ins for lighting tests.  This insistence on perfection shows in this movie.  In many, many cases the lighting is below the action, creating a really strange, horror-movie effect.  There is indirector lighting, showcasing modernist architecture - to such an extent that modernism almost becomes a character in the movie.<br /><br />We created a modernist world.  It's self-image was that we've created nothing better than this world - we foresaw this world with "futuristic" looks at the potential of technology as seen in world fair (like the contemporary 1964 New York World's Fair).  This perfected technology has now destroyed us all, in the single catastrophic episode which ends this movie.<br /><br />But never forget:  it's not the end.  There was no mine shaft gap.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>I had seen 'Dr. Strangelove' several times prior to purchasing the Special Edition DVD, but have never enjoyed it as much. The film is the standout satire from the 1960's and is still a viable cautionary tale of human foibles. Many other reviewers have gone into great detail summarizing the plot, so I will only mention that it concerns a crazy General (Sterling Hayden) who sends his bombers to Russia in an attempt to destroy the Communists, and the pandemonium that ensues.<p>The film is unbelievably tightly edited and is probably Kubrick's greatest work. The single largest contribution to the success of the film is the superior casting, led by Peter Sellers in a virtuoso performance as Lionel Mandrake, an honorable British military officer, as the US President, and as the ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove, the half crazy scientific advisor to the President in his most over the top performance ever. Supporting Sellers are Sterling Hayden, who plays the best dark lunatic ever on film, and the brilliant George C. Scott, playing a juvenile General Buck Turgidson proving without doubt that he was capable of comedic roles. My favorite of the smaller roles has to be that of the rather dense Colonel 'Bat' Guano, played so effectively by Keenan Wynn. Also contributing to the realism of the film were the brilliant sets which, though not based in reality, are very effective at conveying the time period and mood. <p>While I think the film is the best satire made in the 1960s, and possibly in film history, and doubtless deserves of the five stars that I have given it for succeeding in telling the cautionary tale that Kubrick intended, Kubrick did take some liberties in the name of satire to reinforce his decidedly leftist point of view about military leadership. Having said that, Murphy's Law is always lurking, so I am not directly criticizing Kubrick's premise as much as I am the fundamental disregard that he had for the stability and maturity of American military personnel (it has now been 41 years since this film was released now and the precautions taken by the US government and military have thus far worked admirably.) My point is not to berate Kubrick, it is to partially address and assuage some complaints which have suggested that this film shows the ineptitude of the military: if this film was a documentary, I would already be in New Zealand. That is the point that is so often missed, this movie is a brilliant black satire about what Kubrick was personally afraid of: it is fiction, just like 'Fail Safe', released later was a more realistic fictional account of accidental nuclear weapons release. I am not implying that a release of nuclear weapons couldn't happen (although I would be more suspect of a rogue state like North Korea or a terrorist organization today), what I am saying that reality is somewhat contrary to the satirical vision Kubrick portrays here. <p>The DVD has several excellent extras, including a documentary of Kubrick, and a wonderful documentary on the making of 'Dr. Strangelove', which revealed some fascinating details about the film. Most interesting to me was that Peter Sellers was originally supposed to play a fourth role, that of Major Kong, but after breaking his leg during filming, which rendered him unable to get around the B-52 set, Slim Pickens was brought in. I wish it had included some raw footage that had been shot of Sellers as Kong. There are also some odd split-screen interviews, and typical features like biographies, trailers (a must see!), and subtitles. <p>This movie is one of the greatest films ever made, and I can't endorse it highly enough to anyone with an eye to black comedy and satire. As for me, I am off for a nice drink of distilled grain alcohol and rainwater.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>As timely as ever as once again we see the Doomsday Clock approaching midnight with all the false bravado of the White House when it comes to its war on terrorism.  Kubrick nailed the Cold War.  The characterizations are spot on.  Peter Sellers has a field day in his multiple roles, with Dr. Strangelove a fantastic parody on the German scientists who came to America to develop the bomb.  General Turgidson made me think of Rumsfeld.  Quick to come up with a snappy reply to any of the questions posed in the War Room as the crisis deepens.  But, the star of the show is Slim Pickens as Major TJ 'King' Kong as he leads the B52 deep into Russian territory determined to find his target.  As Kubrick noted, the scenario was so absurd that humor was the only treatment possible, steering a different course than the novel he loosely based the movie on, Red Alert.</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>The blackest of comedies that miraculously manages to not sacrifice satire for the sake of propaganda, and make even nuclear war funny.

Lots of old top-loading VCRs that seemed bigger than xerox machines, crummy, uncomfortable furniture, lousy headphones. And I was laughing hysterically (in a library, mind you) for nearly the entire film, right to the Vera Miles song at the end that accompanied stunning shots of actual atomic explosions.<p>One of the strengths of this film, unlike most from this era, is that it's Cold War-themed story does not seem outdated. Kubrick leaves most of the politics on the sidelines to focus on the absurdity, and to let the satire ring brilliantly.<p>Yes it's a left-leaning film, but it's also very damn funny and never self-rightous--it's much more intelligent than that. Kubrick's merciless portrayal of the military could be offensive to those who refuse to  understand what satire actually is.<p>But, if you really have a sense of humor about the madness of war and politics--regardless of what side of the divide you're on--I'm sure this will rank among your favorites.

And Peter Sellers' performance in all three of his roles is one of the best I've seen. It's shot in black & white, and very beautiful. And of course in a Kubrick film, everything means something. Unfortunately it isn't a widescreen edition, and there is no commentary, but those are the only faults I can find. There's a short documentary on Kubrick's shorts and early films. There's a pretty good documentary on the Making of Dr. Strangelove. The animated menu is done simply and brillaintly. It has the original theatrical trailor for the film, which was pretty cutting edge. Also there is the trailer for Fail Safe, and for some reason they threw in the trailer for Anatomy of a Murder, though I don't really see why. Even the case it comes in is elegantly designed.

I'm so glad Sony has decided to re-release this masterwork in a brand-new print on DVD, as it is well worth appreciating again, especially as we go through the uncertainty of American imperialism in Iraq. This movie, however, focuses on a different target, the Soviet Union, our then-competing superpower, and how the U.S. manages the threats of a demented general hell-bent on dropping nuclear payloads onto Russia. His motivation for attack is rooted in a paranoia-driven "Commie plot" he is convinced the Russians are hatching through the flouridation of the water supply in the U.S. This far-fetched premise is played out not by stand-up comedians ridiculing the government for cheap laughs but by a cast of accomplished actors who seem to be playing their roles quite seriously.<br /><br />Propelled by a smart, insightful and hilarious script by Kubrick and Terry Southern, this straight-faced approach makes the gravity of the situation all the more resonant, while making their characters' failures all the more bitingly funny. Aside from the unblinking honesty of the script, the acting is brilliant for the most part with an eccentric cast that includes Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens. In a triple play of comedy genius, Peter Sellers portrays a British Army captain who tries to reason with the general; the title character, a German-accented strategist with an uncontrollable right hand and an eerie similarity to Henry Kissinger; and funniest of all, the U.S. President, an Adlai Stevenson look-alike whose soft-spoken manner is challenged by the mad scramble of events that depend on his leadership.  In fact, Sellers' scenes in the War Room as President Merkin Muffley are hysterical in the very conflict of personalities that give rise to the inevitable ending. As brilliantly versatile as Sellers is, I still believe George C. Scott, with his rubbery face, exaggerated gestures and macho manner, gives the film's best performance as yet another general, a gung-ho type more than ready to take out the Russians. The climax of the film encapsulates the absurdity and gravity of the story well with Pickens astride a nuclear missile like a rodeo cowboy riding a bucking steer. Kubrick was never as funny with his subsequent films (even "The Shining" seems misbegotten by comparison), which is a shame since he had an acute gift for capturing the seriousness of human failure within the context of dark comedy.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD package has loads of extras, most of which bring added context for the timeless significance of the film despite its Cold War setting. These include several good documentaries - an informative one focused on the making of the film itself, plus two others that trace the careers of Kubrick and Sellers, respectively; and finally, a new film that explains the sociological influence of the film today. Strongly recommended even if you feel you've seen it many times before.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (wow what a title eh?) still packs a big wallop today, in both its humor and its overall satire. Maybe it doesn't have the same affect on us today now that Russia has fallen and our enemies aren't major powers with high nuclear capabilities, but that doesn't mean it still doesn't stand as a testament of how people felt about something...and more importantly, how they could laugh at it.<br /><br />And there is a lot to laugh at in this movie, whether its just fun or it means something. There's General Turgeson reading off ten to twenty million American deaths in a Russian retaliation and calling it "getting our hair muffed." There's the classic scene of Slim Pickens' riding the nuclear bomb down like he was at a rodeo. And of course, who can forget Dr. Strangelove getting out of his chair and declaring, "MEIN FUHRER! I CAN WALK!" I can always depend on this movie for a good laugh.<br /><br />I have to also say I was really, really impressed with this DVD. There was a great documentary that tells you all you would want to know about the movie and it's creation, there are recorded interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, trailers, and original images and posters in the image gallery.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good buy. A classic movie, and a worthy DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>I love political satire and it doesn't get any better than this! Having Peter Sellers in the mix (in three roles no less) just makes it that much better. I knew he was funny and could pull off a foreign accent in the Panther films but to pull off British, American and German? The man's a genius! One of my favorite lines of the film is when he tells the General and Russian Ambassador:<br />"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"<br />The supporting cast is stellar as well; George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are excellent as the war crazed and psychotic generals. Slim Pickens is outrageous as he rides his bomb to oblivion. The innuendo throughtout is quite amusing because you have to be quick to pick up on them, like the names of characters, phallic images and so on. The idea of "nuclear armageddon" has aged little with the passage of time, even after the Cold War has ended. The way this film holds up today is incredible (and judging from our current relations with North Korea, couldn't be summed up better than with this).</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Dr. Strangelove, originally released in 1964, is an American classic.

For me when I watch this film it's actually a little more on the disturbing side than funny because it's really not so far fetched,both back when it was made and in the present time. Dr.Strangelove is presented in black & white but is wildly colorful in it's witty content. This is truly a must have for Kubrick fans and anyone who has half a brain and a sense of humor.

Peter Sellers in three equally hilarious roles is at his absurdist best, but Sterling Hayden as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, and George C.

Scott) had an important meeting at the Pentagon to resolve the crisis.<br /><br />George C. Scott was the man to see in the film. He had great speeches to make and his convictions were unfaltered right to the end. Peter Sellers (as the President, the aide captain to the mad general as well as the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove) was everywhere in the film. I never saw Peter Sellers in such a serious role as the President.  The most impressive shot is the one when the military man riding on the bomb down to USSR.<br /><br />Many parts of the film was documentary like, deliberatley so. But I can't help noticing that(1) 18 minutes before the bomb was to be on USSR soil, the Presidents of the 2 countries were still exchanging pleasantries on the phone. (2) the man on the falling bomb was holding in a position most convenient for the camera but defying gravity nevertheless. (3) the captain (Peter Sellers) could manage to phone the President from a military base. All these begged disbelief and contributed the comical/cynical elements to the film, they were more symbolic than anything else.<br /><br />A film with sarcastic, dark moments and an ending to be pondered.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>There are few scenes in cinematic history that are more indelibly etched into the publics imagination like the image of Slim Pickens rodeo-riding a nuclear bomb on its way to oblivion.  While this is one of the final scenes in "Dr. Strangelove... Or, How I learned to Stop Worry and Love the Bomb", it showcases that strangely dark comedic tone that immerses the entire movie.  At the time the movie was released (1964, scheduled for late 1963, but postponed because of Kennedy's assassination), panic over the prospect of mutually assured destruction as a result of a nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union overwhelmed the American public.  1962's Cuban Missile Crisis did little to assuage those fears.  That same year, a writer named Peter George wrote a novel called "Red Alert" where the premise was the occurrence of accidental nuclear war.  It was made into a movie called "Fail Safe" that had a very somber tone focusing on the horror of that occurrence.  At the same time, odd-ball director Stanley Kubrick decided to take the premise of "Red Alert" of make his own movie based on it.  However, during the course of scripting it for the screen, Kubrick realized that several of the scenes could be and were actually quite funny.  So, he decided to change the tone from a serious war movie to a black comedy.  The result was a truly landmark film. <p>The audience gets an early hint of its off-beat nature with the first of many 'unique' names.  Deranged General Jack D. Ripper (played with commanding menace by Sterling Hayden) decides to close off Burpelson Air Force Base to the outside world and send commands to his bombers holding at their fail-safe points to proceed to bombing targets in the Soviet Union.  Ripper's rationale is that the Soviets have invaded America in the most gruesome way possible: infiltrating their bodily fluids with fluoride(!!!).  The almost hapless administration of President Merkin Muffley convenes in an underground war room to figure out what went wrong and how to undo it.  The president's main military advisor is General Buck Turgidson; a psychotic old warhorse who thinks this accidental launch is a blessing in a disguise and that America should launch all their weapons on the Russians and destroy them while suffering 'only' 20-30 million casualties, tops(!).  <p>Turgidson's view is what the U.S. may have realized had General Patton had his way at the end of World War II.  It should come as no surprise that the roles of General Turgidson in this movie and General Patton is his biopic 7 years later were both played by actor George C. Scott.  Those who loved "Patton" will see the seeds of the performance beginning to sprout in "Dr. Strangelove..".  <p>President Muffley enlists the services of one Dr. Strangelove, an exiled German scientist, to help figure out how to resolve this predicament (avoiding the attack which will trigger the Russians 'Doomsday' bomb).  Dr. Strangelove worked on the A-Bomb project for the Nazis and seems to have a difficult time controlling the actions of his right hand.<p>There are too many well-realized characters to address each one individually and still do them justice.  The true star is the way in which Kubrick satirizes the nuclear policies of the time and the overall nuclear fears.  Prevalent at the time were the concerns over the 'bomb gap', the difference between the number of bombs the U.S. had versus the number the Russians had.  When the Turgidson and company become aware of the Russian "Doomsday' device, they complain about the 'Doomsday Gap'.  When it becomes obvious that there is no way to stop the iminent nuclear attack, the president and his advisors begin discussing ways to preserve the American way of life through the use of mine shafts for people to live in until it is safe, they argue about avoiding a 'mine shaft gap' with the Russians.  It seems to be Kubrick's intention to illuminate the absurdity of the real-life debates with the extreme concerns in this movie.  He does so expertly.  Of course, there is the one truly memorable line uttered by President Muffley when Turgidson and the Russian ambassador get into a scuffle, "Gentleman! You can't fight here!  This is the War Room!".<p>Beyond the tone of the movie, there are several other unique aspects to "Dr. Strangelove..." that also help elevate to one of the top movies in history.  Legendary British actor Peter Sellers played not one, but three (!), roles in this movie.  He is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF (who tries to talk General Ripper out of his mad plan), President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove.  He was rumored to be slated to play Major T.J. "King" Kong, but he suffered a leg injury and the role was given to Slim Pickens.  It's just as well, because one would find it hard to imagine even an actor as gifted as Sellers performing the southern hick pilot role nearly as well as Pickens did.  It is also notable that this is the very first movie that James Earl Jones appeared in.<p>The final scenes show a series of nuclear explosions, but not in a manner that depicts horror or destruction.  It is almost poetic how the explosions flash in tune with Vera Lynn's light "We'll Meet Again" song.  Deft satirical directing like that is what enables "Dr. Strangelove" to be as popular today as it was almost 40 years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>I have been used to Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies but this 1964 movie is WONDERFUL!

The tale is a satire with over the top characters who justify their crazy behavior in, yes, over the top manners.  Peter Seller's recent success in playing multiple characters in LOLITA gets him three roles in this film (U.S. President, RAF second Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove) and arguably his most memorable is as the crippled, queer smiling borderline Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove.  Some of the humor is a bit dated but some of it is still pretty funny to watch.  The complexity of this picture might confuse some viewers.  This film won AFI recognition over several years.

Some took the threat of Russian invasion quite seriously. Others chose a less credible, but wholly more satisfying route into pure farcical escapist entertainment. Of particular interest in this latter category is Stanley Kubrick's intense black comedy about the nuclear age; "Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb." "The film, frequently adorning "all-time best" lists, is a vapid spoof that teeters on political insanity and military incredulity.  The story begins as homage to the Cubin Missile Crisis, with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), an obsessed relic, launching his own personal assault on Communism. Ripper commissions a squadron of B-52s to bomb the USSR. Naturally, the big bad Russians launch their own counter offensive - the so- called "Doomsday Device." While the world holds its excess gas, U.S. President (Peter Sellers) enters into riotous hot-line negotiations with his Commi-counterpart. Always fascinating to watch, Sellers also interjects his own inimitable brand of craziness into two more roles; a British military attach&eacute; with a humorous tick and the psychotic bomb-maker, Dr. Strangelove. This trio of psychotics is fleshed out by Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants loose canon whose military advice boils down into two parts mass hysteria and one part factoid meaningless statistics.<br /><br />This is the third outing for "Dr. Strangelove" on DVD. As with its predecessors, this disc exhibits a stunningly rich and textured visual presentation. The B&W image has a marvelously balanced and remarkably solid gray scale. Blacks are velvety deep and smooth. There is some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but nothing that will distract you from enjoying this classic. Multiple aspect ratios are in keeping with the film's original theatrical presentation. The movie also boasts 5.1 DTS. This 40th anniversary edition also embellishes its extras made previously available with two more short subjects. Overall, there's little reason to run out and re-buy this title, although die hard fans will ultimately want the very latest from the military board room in the cockpit of their own libraries. Either way, brace yourself - its blast off time for the neurotic age!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>DR. STRANGELOVE is many things to many people.  It is one of the most brilliant dark comedies every made.  It is one of the most powerful protests against military insanity ever created.  It is Peter Sellers greatest film, and Stanley Kubrick's greatest film.  And, to one disgruntled soul who left the theater screaming in disgust at how "it makes a mockery of our country's military!" it is a denunciation of the American "strength through power" mindset.  It is also the most deadpan film ever made.  <p>I know of few films that contain so many utterly perfect moments as this one.  Kubrick's brilliance is the way he takes these potentially disparate moments and blends them into a magnificent, coherent whole.  Anyone who has seen STRANGELOVE will have his or her own set of best moments.  Mine includes:  George C. Scott's obsessive gum chewing; Peter Sellers as the president shouting, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!"; General Jack Ripper's disquisition on bodily fluids; Kennan Wynn's Col. "Bat" Guano warning Capt. Mandrake that he will have to answer to the Coca Cola company; everything that Slim Pickens says throughout the film; "When Johnny Comes Marching Home"; President Muffley's long phone conversation with Dmitri, the Soviet premier; and, last, but not least, Dr. Strangelove himself (who resembles nothing so much as FDR if he had been an insane ex-Nazi).<p>In 1964, when this film was made, the idea of nuclear war was horrific to everyone.  Bomb shelters were being sold everywhere, and one of the hot exhibitions at any State Fair would be the one displaying the shelter models out that year.  Numerous movies were made trying to drive home the seriousness of the threat.  But Kubrick, instead, made a comedy about it, partly, unquestionably, to point up the absurdity of the entire situation.  But perhaps also to give us some perspectives on ourselves, on our tendency to demonize "the other," on our silly assumptions, and perhaps as a way of deflating some of the tension of the situation by helping us all to laugh at ourselves.  There have been many "topical" films made over the decades, but perhaps none has managed to so completely transcend its particular period of time as to become a masterpiece for any and all times.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is one of the best films ever made, a comedy worthy of Voltaire or Cervantes, and a thriller to rival the best Hollywood ever produced.  I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.<p>Part of the inspiration for Kubrick's satirical masterpiece came from the publication in the fifties and early sixties of such absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's "On Thermonuclear War" in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate.  Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake.  Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was realized some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a "nuclear winter" that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S.  Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago.  Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.<p>Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented as a comedic thriller.  As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) ... <p>One of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that it almost happened.  During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare.  Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Watching the recent funeral and memorial tributes for the late Ronald Reagan speaker after speaker praised the former President for his part in ending the Cold War.  My 18 year old daughter asked me what the Cold War was about.  I tried telling her about the iron curtain and the Berlin Wall and nuclear proliferation, then I realized that I had the perfect movie to demonstrate some of the fears that gripped most of the civilized world while the USA and former Soviet Union had their respective nuclear arsenals aimed at each other.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick took a chance making an over-the-top black comedy about nuclear war, but the payoff is evident.  George C. Scott in a broad comedic farce?  Believe it!  He riffs with Peter Sellers' President Muffley in a way that absolutely must be seen.  Sellers has played comedic madness in many other films, but as President Muffley he is the straight man to Mr. Scott's General Turgidson, who is out of control trying to explain why one of his Base Commanders has ordered all of his B-52's to deliver their nuclear payloads into the Soviet Union in the diabolique "Plan R" - the contingency plan which was put into place to allow lower level military leaders to continue the war after a "sneak attack" had wiped out Washington and the rest of the military big-wigs. Legend has it that Kubrick tricked several of the actors into their performances.  Supposedly George C. Scott didn't know that the film was a satire and played Turgidson straight, and after a few takes Kubrick would say "now let's do one over the top - just for fun", then used only the "over the top" takes in the film.  Legend has it that Scott was mad (who wouldn't be at being tricked) but Kubrick got the right performances into the film.<br /><br />Sellers gives a tour-de-force performance in three roles, and the most interesting one to me is as Group Captain Mandrake, the 2nd in command to Sterling Hayden's deranged General Jack D. Ripper. General Ripper is the kind of paranoid patriot who thinks that "the only good commie is a dead commie", and when I was growing up there were men like this everywhere in America. (Their children grew up to form the Tea Party.) I met some in the service too, and it's not much of a stretch to imagine one becoming a general who would decide to "take the initiative" and begin World War III with a pre-emptive nuclear strike.<br /><br />The other main sub-plot takes place in one of the B-52s that General Ripper has sent off on Plan R.  Slim Pickens is an absolute hoot as the pilot, and finding out later than Kubrick had told Slim that this was a patriotic war film and that Slim was playing "Major Kong" straight makes his performance that much funnier.  Kong's crew play it even straighter than Slim, and as their plane gets closer and closer to dropping the big one there is palpable tension that mounts, ending with one of the most memorable visuals ever as Slim rides the bomb down to it's destination, waving his cowboy hat and hooping and hollering.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I never imagined that anyone could successfully satirize a subject as scary and gruesome such as nuclear war and destruction.  While it isn't as prevalent as it was during the Cold War, the threat still exists, and it is a scary one.  And yet, Stanley Kubric's Dr. Strangelove is a perfectly good example of a satirical look at such a subject.<br /><br />Filmed in black and white, the movie chronicles a few hours in the worst day in human history.  A high-ranking United States general, General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden), has recently gone insane with rage, paranoia, and fear of the Soviets.  He has decided to execute an order reserved for sneak attacks; basically, in the event of a surprise attack on Washington, D.C., it allows someone besides the president to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.  He quarantines the entire base, making everyone believe that they are under attack, and the only person who sees through the madness is his executive officer, British officer Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers).<br /><br />Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley (Sellers) has called a conference of top US generals, including Gen. Bucky Turgidson (George C. Scott), Russian ambassador Sadesky (Peter Bull), and German nuclear expert Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again).  While at the conference in an underground War Room, the president learns about the improbability of being able to call back the fighters, as well as the existence of a Russian doomsday device that cannot be shut down.<br /><br />While the president desperately attempts to call back the planes on their way to Russia, circumstances in the air make things even more complicated, one of which being that the pilot of one of the planes, Major T.J. "King" Kong (Slim Pickens) is extremely gung-ho about the mission.<br /><br />Many different aspects of the film are wonderfully used to satirize the situation.  From character names such as Kissov, "Bat" Guano, "King" Kong, Turgidson, and Strangelove, to the hilarious dialogue that has become some of the most famous lines that everyone knows, but doesn't know the origin.  Some of the famous lines include, "You can't fight in here!  This is the war room!".  Even some of the situations are priceless, such as the one involving Mandrake and the Coke machine.<br /><br />It truly is amazing how brilliant this movie is.  Never before have I laughed so hard at a subject that sends chills down my spine.  The whole film was very well executed, and is definitely worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>The movie is legendary, so I won't bother with the obvious!  I will however, take the opportunity to test my memory in "public" with perhaps my favorite sequence in the entire film...<br /><br />"Hello?  Uh, hello, Dimitri?  Listen, can't hear too well.  Do you suppose you could turn the music down just a little?  Ah, that's better.  Yes, I can hear you now, Dimitri.  Clear and plain and coming through fine.  I'm coming through fine, too, ayy?  Well then, like you say, it's good that I'm fine and you're fine.  I agree with you, it great to be fine.  Ha, ha, ha,ha.  Now then, Dimitri, you know, how, we've always talked about the possibility...of something going wrong with the bomb.  The bomb, Dimitri.  The hydrogen bomb.  Well, what happened was, one of our base commanders, he went; well, he went a little funny in the head.  You know, just a little...funny; and he went and did a silly thing.  Well, I'll tell you what he did; he ordered our planes...to attack your country.  Well, let me finish, Dimitri.  Let me finish, Dimitri.  Listen, how do you think I feel about this?  Can you imagine how I feel about this, Dimitri?  Why do you think I'm calling you?  Just to say hello?  Oh course I like to speak to you!  Of course I like to say hello!  Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.  I'm just calling to tell you something terrible...it's a friendly call, of course it's a friendly call.  Listen, if it wasn't friendly...you probably wouldn't have gotten it."<br /><br />Whew!  I could go on and on, but it gets exhausting!  Love, love, love this movie!<br /><br />Miss you, Stanley.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This movie is lame.  There isn't one good laugh in it.  It is tiresome.  The only good thing about it is that it warns us against right wing lunatics who might start a nuclear war because they are crazy.  Fine.  It is politically correct.  But that doesn't mean that the movie is any good, and it isn't.  I have hated almost every Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen.  His work is terrible.  The best of the sorry lot is Barry Lyndon, which is too long, too slow paced, has no characters who aren't annoying and despicable, but is worth three stars, which is more than I can say for the rest of his garbage.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Dr. Strangelove, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)<br /><br />I've always found it somewhat amusing that when it comes to Stanley Kubrick's movies, I dovetail almost exactly with everyone else I know. If you ask Kubrick fans what their favorite Kubrick films are, you will get the almost universal answer of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove. I finally saw the former all the way through for the first time a couple of months ago, and it was just as bad as I figured it would be from the pieces I'd seen. Now, I've seen the latter, which I again assumed would be terrible based on what I'd seen of it; unlike 2001, though, in this case I'd actually underestimated how thoroughly horrible this movie is. (And, for the record, of the Kubrick movies I've seen-- I'm still missing a few-- my two favorites are, by far, The Killing and Lolita.)<br /><br />Critics back when it came out, of course, immediately compared it to Fail-Safe, the other 1964 film about the War Room. It was inevitable, really. The main difference between the two films is that Fail-Safe plays it straight and goes for tension, while Dr. Strangelove goes for satire. The biggest problem is that the satire just isn't funny. It's the same tired old antiwar message crap we've heard a million times before. There's no thought given to characters or plot at all; it all exists for the sole purpose of poking fun at anyone who's not a hard-line antiwar activist. (Reportedly, Peter George, upon whose novel the film is based, despised it-- probably for that reason.) There is no attempt at subtlety here, no attempt at artistry. There are many attempts at humor; all of them fail. Now, I grant you, they might actually be hilarious, but I couldn't tell; I was too busy reeling from getting hit in the head with the antiwar hammer over and over again.<br /><br />This is the big difference between the infinitely superior Fail-Safe and this pile of garbage; Fail-Safe actually hands the viewer a worthwhile story, characters for whom the viewer is capable of feeling sympathy/antipathy, plot development, the works. In other words, it's actually a movie rather than a collection of unfunny jokes around a theme. Dr. Strangelove is, in no uncertain terms, one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting all the way through. It may not be the worst, but it's certainly in the top five. (zero)</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>ok, some minimal thrill but not worth spending the time watching it. The so called humor was ineffective. The scene with the cowboy riding the bomb down was a sad reminder of the cowboy diplomacy that's been running the country for 8 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film is one of the few where a star rating does it no justice.  Praise for this film is infinite.  This ranks as one of the great acts of chutzpah in American film-making.  Imagine this:  A dark comedy about a renegade general unleashing nuclear terror released on the heels of the Cuban missile crisis.  Kubrick and his collaborators(that include author Terry Southern) knew something that more serious films (i.e Stanley Kramer's "Fail-Safe") didn't.  They knew that a more effective way to educate the public to the dangers of nuclear proliferation is to emphasize the insanity of it all.  Kubrick assembled a first-rate cast to convey this message.  Peter Sellers plays three roles superbly: the rationale yet panicky President of the U.S., a British group captain attached to the general who unleashes the nuclear attacks, and the titular character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German nuclear scientist whose arm involuntarily goes into a Nazi salute.  George C. Scott is superb as General Turgidson who seems more concerned with beating the "Russkies" with their pants down than averting doomsday.  Sterling Hayden is effectively psychotic as General Ripper whose obsession with fluordation sets these events in motion.  Slim Pickens is hilarious as the cowboy Major Kong whose sense of duty is admirable to a fault.  Interestingly, this role was originally supposed to be played by Sellers but he did not feel he could do justice to it.  Good call, Peter.  In smaller roles Peter Bull, Keenan Wynn, and James Earl Jones do admirable jobs.  As usual, Kubrick's ingenious use of existing music(instead of an original score) is impeccable.  The sets service the film well, particularly the war room with the big board.  "Dr Strangelove" is not just a great comedy but a landmark in film history.  The DVD contains a decent documentary, considering that most Kubrick discs skimp or are bereft of any extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>With no reservations I can say that this is the greatest  piece of satire that has ever been put to film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is a war satire that drives home a very important (and still too familiar in post-Cold War America) point about nuclear warfare. the characters are hilarious. Sellers, in his 3 roles, has you on the floor laughing. Surprisingly, so does Scott. The film scenes are realistic with tight spaces or documentary-worthy war footage. The acting is great. The directing is phenomenol. There is not a single bad thing about this movie. The ending is comical and very, very dark. I could watch this movie daily and not be tired of it.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>It is the midst of the Cold War, and America has Russia surrounded by B-52 bombers each equipped with a H-Bomb, just in case. A psychotic, fluid and fluoride obsessed general (Sterling Hayden) one day decides to let them fly, and gives the command to the pilots, which he does without the permission of the President. This sends the US government, deep within their war room, into a panic. Will the President (Peter Sellers), with the help of the creepily grinning Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers), be able to stop the H Bombs, or will the world be obliterated in a Nuclear holocaust?<br /><br />This is the world of "Dr Strangelove", Stanley Kubrick's 1963 film. This dark satire at the time was a very topical film, and a film I've been meaning to see for some time, being interested in Kubrick and a fan of Peter Sellers. I'm really glad I managed to get a hold of this DVD and see it. It is a very witty, well thought out film.<br /><br />The acting's pretty interesting. The characters of the politicians and generals are often pretty petty, not the kinds of people you'd want handling a dire situation like this, but they aren't exactly parodies, they try to keep their serious face on, you could see politicans and generals acting like this in such a crisis. For a film whose plot involves politics, protocols and special aircraft controls, it's very easy to understand and to follow. It could have been a lot more complicated, but its not, and the satirical parts get to shine through. The aircraft controls, for instance, which are vital plot elements, are clearly marked and given their own shots. Though times have changed since 1963, I wouldn't say the film has dated that much either.<br /><br />On this version of the DVD, there's a nice little selection of special features. Theres a featurette called "The Art of Stanley Kurbrick", which briefly documents Kubrick's early life, his first job as a photographer, and his films up to "Dr Strangelove". There's a meatier, 45 minute documentary called "Inside The Making of Doctor Strangelove" which documents the production and controversies of the film. It was interesting to discover that the set for the B-52 cockpit was so accurate, that Kubrick was confronted by the FBI. There's a few little tidbits like this, and its fascinating. There's also a "split screen" interview with George C. Scott and Peter Sellers, where the screen is split in half, and the actor gives pre recorded answers to scripted questions, which a presenter of the show reads, appearing on the other side of the screen (though in this feature it is blank and there is no one). I have never seen one of these kinds of interviews before, apparently they happened quite often at the time, and it was intriguing to watch. I particularly like the Peter Sellers part of the interview, which he does with his President character's accent, then goes on to discuss and act out accents of the English speaking world, shifting fluidly from one to another. A talented guy. There's also a picture gallery of promotional material (original posters, lobby cards, etc), some talent profiles, selected filmographies of the cast and Kubrick and the very original 1960s trailer with its ever flicking frames and words, which is just as quirky as the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Kubrick and lovers of satire.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's funny, I've seen 3 previous Kubrick movies before this: A Clockwork Orange, the Shining and 2001. Only the Shining I liked as Clockwork seemed kind of boring and 2001 seemed really slow at times. Dr Strangelove is one of the few that I like and although I didn't find it a laugh riot all the way through, its satire and funny dialogue was perfect, and the performances were great as well.<br /><br />An Air Force commander goes nuts and convinces a fleet of planes that Russia is planning an attack so he calls for an action to nuke them. The film switches between 3 locales mainly: the War Room with the President and other government officials, the crazy commander and a soldier trying to get him to stop and inside the plane, on their way to bombing Russia.<br /><br />The performances are quite excellent with George C. Scott playing quite an animated Officer while Peter Sellers plays no less than 3 roles: the President, Mandrake, the officer trying to stop the rogue commander and Dr Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist in a wheelchair. Then of course there's Slim Pickens who replaced what was supposed to be Peter Sellers' 4th character as Major Kong. Also look for James Earl Jones, later being of course the voice of Darth Vader.<br /><br />One of the most well-known images of the film is Major King yahooing on the nuclear bomb all the way down to annihilation. Whether this was the first time that a big vertical tracking shot was shown but it sure seems familiar now. Pearl Harbor's infamous shot, the boulder in Return of the King and even the end to Temple of Doom had similar shots so either this was the start or it was another homage but it's certainly a famous shot.<br /><br />It's best if you go with the Anniversary Edition since the image is more cleaner. I watched the SE and there was print flaws all over the place. There's a couple new features which probably doesn't seem like much but for the best looking, get the Anniversary edition.<br /><br />It's certainly a funny movie and a well-made one and Kubrick, who is usually known for precision and coldness rather than emotional films, it's nice to see one that I actually like.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>I had seen 'Dr. Strangelove' several times prior to purchasing the Special Edition DVD, but have never enjoyed it as much. The film is the standout satire from the 1960's and possibly of all time. The film is unbelievably tightly edited and is probably Kubrick's greatest work. The single largest contribution to the success of the film is the superior casting, led by Peter Sellers in a virtuoso triple performance. Supporting Sellers are Sterling Hayden, who plays the best dark lunatic ever on film, and the brilliant George C. Scott, as General Buck Turgidson. My favorite of the smaller roles has to be that of the rather dense Colonel 'Bat' Guano, played so effectively by Keenan Wynn. Also contributing to the realism of the film were the brilliant sets which are very effective at conveying the time period and mood.  <p>The DVD has several excellent extras, including a documentary on Kubrick, and a wonderful documentary on the making of 'Dr. Strangelove'. There are also some odd interviews, and typical features like biographies, trailers (a must see!), and subtitles. <p>This movie is one of the greatest films ever made, and I can't endorse it highly enough to anyone with an eye to black comedy and satire.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Kubrick produced, directed, and co-authored the screen play of this film, one which has lost none of its bite after almost 40 years. In that same year, Sidney Lumet's Fail Safe was also released. Both pose the same question "What if someone accidentally launched an air strike armed with thermonuclear weapons...and it could not be recalled?" However, they offer quite different answers. Credit Stanley Kramer's On the Beach (1959) with alerting the world to a possibility which seemed a probability when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed in October of 1962. In sharp contrast with Fail Safe which remains earnest but now seems somewhat stale and certainly dated, those who see Dr. Strangelove still savor the genius of Peter Sellers as he plays three major characters (President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake), joined by a surprisingly hilarious George C. Scott (General Buck Turgison) and Sterling Hayden (as psychotic General Jack D. Ripper, self-appointed defender of his nation's precious body fluids). They and other cast members create one memorable comic moment after another. The film concludes as Slim Pickens' Major T.J. ("King") Kong prepares to engage in what he calls "Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!" Few other film comedies have held up this well, especially after almost four decades. One final point. I am so appreciative of the DVD format which, of course, offers clearer sound and image but also of supplementary mnaterial such as the featurette: "The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove" and the documentary: "Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove."</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>It is so easy to review great movies. All I have to say is see one of the best movies ever made. It influenced an entire generation of filmgoers and film-makers.<p>If you think this material is dated, just think &quot;missle defense shield&quot; and remember that several thousand nuclear warheads are still targeted on us and they are in the control of a country that seems, at times, on the verge of being out-of-control. We are still in the grip of the madness of nuclear weapons and the fraility of human beings who create and control them.<p>That such a serious topic could ever be the basis for one of the funniest movies ever made is still staggeringly ironic. This directorial tour-de-force, by itself, insures Kubrick's name will always be in the pantheon of world-class artists. It is so brilliantly photographed and composed, and it is so economical! It tells a big story deftly and surely, without a missed note.<p>Peter Sellers is superb in 3 roles. Absolutely on the mark as President Muffley, Group Captain Mandrake, and, of course, the title's namesake, the misbegotten Dr.Strangelove with the unrepentant Nazi arm with a mind of its own. The other great performance is Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, followed closely by Slim Pickens as Col. &quot;King&quot; Kong. I don't believe time has been as kind to George C. Scott's Gen. Buck Turgidson. I love Scott as an actor, and it is a good comic performance, but it borders too much on slapstick and edges awfully close to over-the-top. When you compare it to Seller's economy and precision (yes, even as Strangelove...it's a controlled performance) and Hayden's dead-on, deadpan delivery I think Scott's performance is revealed as more mannered &amp; superficial. But, a minor digression from a wonderful cast and film, and a matter of taste.<p>One of the all-time great comedies about the end of the world! What more is there to say? Just see it! And, if you have already seen it, see it again. It is a timeless Classic!<p>And by all means, let's make sure there is never a mineshaft gap!</p></br></body></html>
