The movie wisely pokes fun at itself and at just about every religious and societal group imaginable.<br /><br />The movie is worth a watch if only for Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as a shallow Ecstasy tripping, sex-obsessed former star.  It's nearly impossible not to break into hysterics at the idea of Dougie Houser getting aroused by (and involved in) a car seat.<br /><br />Hardly great movie making, Harold & Kumar is still a helluva lot of fun.  Especially under the influence.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>This succeeds where most fail.

It's not great (nobody there is claiming to be a gourmet chef), but it gets the job done.<br /><br />"Harold & Kumar" works in a similar fashion.  Another stoner-buddy comedy (owing as much to Cheech and Chong as it does to Chapelle's "Half-Baked"), this movie takes the road-trip/quest concept (which, as the title suggests, is essentially just one huge plug for the fast food chain) and uses it as an excuse to string together a series of sketches on weed, women, and ... racism?<br /><br />The movie is chock full of stereotypes, but don't worry; they're so self-aware that they do everything but wink at the audience.  From the hyper-religious freak (who happens to have a smokin' hot wife) to the rude and crude eXtreme sports dudes (one of them is actually called "Extreme Sports Punk #1"), we are given something cliched, and then it is spun on its head (the boil-covered religious man turns out to be big on group sex; the eXtreme sports dudes ... well ... they have interesting taste in music).  If there's one thing about "Harold and Kumar" that works, it is its happy subversiveness.<br /><br />But is it funny?<br /><br />That's hard to gauge sometimes, especially when you're talking about a movie that relies so heavily on boob shots.  Harold and Kumar, in addition to being hungry for bite-sized, steam-cooked burgers, are also always up for a toke (in fact, their Castle quest is inspired by the munchies), but these guys don't ever really seem all that high (a state of mind which would give more credibility to this weed-obsessed movie).  Instead, they're actually pretty smart and clear-headed.  On the other hand, the rest of the film is SO cartoonish and weird (vengeful cops, placaple cheetahs, college chicks who play grotesque toilet games) that the gags only work about as much as a typical Bugs Bunny joke, [...].  Granted, Bugs is pretty funny, but only when he's not trying to make a point.<br /><br />In the same way, this movie is spot-on when, like Bugs, it goes for the wistfully irreverent (e.g. Anthony Anderson's wistful and blustering Burger Shack employee), the playfully vindictive (e.g. Neil Patrick Harris as himself-on-E), or the just plain absurd (e.g. Jamie Kennedy's hilarious cameo as a creepy guy in the woods).  It's all well and good that the movie wants to make a point (or two), but instead of going for the hazy epiphany (like stoners are wont to do), this flick should've just stuck with the giggles and the bloodshot eyes.<br /><br />This DVD comes with a plethora of special features.  Highlights include the deleted scenes (some of which aren't bad at all), and the outtakes (which are good as well, but a little short).</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Released July 20, 2004. As soon as you load the DVD, John Cho and Kal Penn are driving in the car talking to each other about this DVD waiting for you to select in option.  But wait!  It's fun to watch the next five minutes play out before you make a choice.<br />  Nice gimmick:  White Castle Hamburgers is a restaurant founded in 1923, but only found back east in the USA.  There are no White Castle Restaurants in the West or Mid-West.  Briefly there was one in Hollywood, California as recent as 2004 for publicity purposes, but now the closest restaurants are in Minnesota and Missouri.<br />  Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are pals who live together.  They get the munchies and then they both see a White Castle Hamburger commercial.  Immediatly, they decide to drive all the way to New Brunswick to the White Castle.  This is just the beginning of a late night adventure.  Harold could eat 20 White Castle hamburgers right now.  He hasn't been to a White Castle in ages.<br />  They finally make it to New Brunswick.  Kumar knows the mega-plex is there, the little White Castle must be across the street.  Well, it is now a Burger Shack.  So now they agree to drive to Cherry Hill to a White Castle, however there are a few unexpected stops along the way.  Will these guys ever make it to White Castle?<br />  I think Hollywood has a brand new comedy team.  I would love to see John Cho and Kal Penn make more movies together.<br />  I think Neil Patrick Harris has demolished his "Doogie Howser" image forever.<br />  That was Christopher Meloni (HBO, "OZ", NBC, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) as "Freakshow".<br />  DVD includes a 12-minute "John Cho & Kal Penn: The Backseat Interview with Bobby Lee".

Kumar is an outgoing genius in the medical field, but does not want to pursue a career as a doctor just because his father and brother, and every other typecasted Indian, are doctors. The one thing these two guys have in common besides living in the same apartment is their love of smoking weed.<br /><br />On one particular night in which the movie takes place, they both get the munchies after a 'joint' session as they begin craving for White Castle after watching the commercial on TV. And that's where the real fun begins. Harold and Kumar face one obstacle after another on their way to the restaurant including a raccoon, a cheetah, a group of palookas who keep on bullying them, a stoned Neil Patrick Harris stealing their car, a long haired freak and his sexy wife, and the cops.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar are the Cheech and Chong of our time. With that said, be sure to see more Harold And Kumar films in the near future, something I'll be waiting for impatiently.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>This movie is by the same director of "Dude, Where's My Car."<br /><br />I hated "Dude, Where's My Car" so I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but this movie is truly funny as HELL. When I first saw it in a store, I read the back and frankly. It looked stupid.<br /><br />But after watching it a little less than 5 minutes I realized how good it was. It's far superior to DWMC and it's probably one of the best stoner/road trip movies since "Cheech & Chongs Up in Smoke". Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are an asian and I think Kumar is like Arabian or something. Anyway, Harold has a job which is pretty professional but he still gets stoned every day with Kumar, whose dad pressures him to go to Med School. One night while getting stoned the two of them see a commercial for<br /><br />White Castle burgers. They suddenly get the muchies and head off to White Castle to find it's no longer there. They then begin a road trip to find the other White Castle and meet a bunch of DWMC-like people. But, see unlike DWMC, Harold and Kumar meet people that aren't as weird as the aliens that were met by the guys in DWMC. But the movie has a lot of funny one-liners, like:<br /><br />Harold: How were Katie Holmes b00bies?<br /><br />Friend: Remember the holocaust?<br /><br />Harold: Yeah.<br /><br />Friend: Picture the exact opposite of that.<br /><br />Then they meet a man named Freakshow who has large pulsing boils all over his face. When they are at his house to get their tire replaced he says:<br /><br />"Ya'll can go inside. Watch TV, get something to eat, f**k my wife. Ya know? Make yourself at home."<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I don't see anything racist about this movie. The two main characters are nowhere near stereotypical asians (sure, Harold and Kumar are intelligent individuals, but they also like to get stoned). However, everyone should agree that this film makes fun of everyone (from white trash to over-achieving Asians to brutal cops to skinheads to whatever), so calling this racist because of (?) the minor stereotypical Asian characters that are present for only a few minutes is idiotic.<br /><br />Anyway, this film's flat-out hilarious.

Two stoners set out on their "quest for munchies" to a White Castle. What I found very different about this movie is that neither of the lead characters are white. It was this little twist that made this movie an "over the top" funny. My favorite part of the movie is when their car broke down and this redneck stops to help them. You will have to watch the movie to totally understand it. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants a good laugh for the night!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>It was a solid funny movie.There was one scene with a cheetah and the two guys rode it and it just wasn't real looking.Other than that it was a decent comedy.Doogie Houser was in it along with (cameo) Jamie Kennedy.I wouldn't buy it for 20 bucks ,more like a 15 dollar movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Forget Part 2 it tries to be too funny, this movie while having stupid moments and a stupid plot, and sadly about two stoners, the movie is funny to the max.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Well, I have to admit that this movie looked very stupid and just terrible. It was very stupid but was, I have to admit, quite funny. It's completely out of control humor with a very stupid but funny plot. This movie for one had the most pot references EVER! (that I've seen) It had a lot of that stuff!<br /><br />The movie is about Harold and Kumar, two roomates, that are planning on having a night where they smoke mucho pot. Harold works hard and is mad because lots of work got dumped on him by his mean co workers. But, later he gets revenge on them! Kumar is the brilliant son of a doctor that doesn't really care that he's smart. They smoke some pot and decide to go to White Castle. But before, there's a hilarious add, showing the deadly consequences of marijuana, but there's so stoned that they jsut laugh at it. From then they invite their friends to go with them but there's busy watching the Gift, because they want to see Katie Holmes's boobs.<br /><br />They then go but get lost and encounter many crazy adventures and meet many whacko people along the way.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for just a really stupid comedy that's actually funny, this one's the one. Neil Patrick Harris costars and is really funny. Kumar's facial expressions are hilarious!<br /><br />Some of the people they encounter on the way are two bombshells with some "problems", a mean racist cop, a cheetah, a crazy guy named Freakshow, and more. The movie is stupid and has some unnecessary moments but gave me a lot of good laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Funny funny movie.

When I first heard of it, I was like, "Seems like a long ad for White Castle to me." But I watched it in theatres anyway! And I loved it!<br /><br /> THE STORY: Harold and Kumar are two stoner roomates. Harold is an Asain dude who has a crush on a girl named Maria, and Kumar is an Indian guy who likes weed. One day they see an ad for White Castle and get hungry! So they drive over there, running into hilarious obstacles along the way!<br /><br /> As you see, it's not a serious movie, but it's fun! The DVD is also sweet! Oh, BTW, the sequel, "Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam" is coming soon!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In the beginning there was "Up in Smoke" with Cheech and Chong. If that was not the original stoner comedy it is at least the most pertinent reference point for considering "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle," because as a society we have clearly moved from a stoner comedy in 1978 starring a Hispanic-American and an Asian-American to a stoner comedy in 2004 starring a pair of Asian-Americans. Not only that, but the two young Asian-Americans are a Korean-American and an Indian-American, and not the Chinese-Americans and Japanese-Americans that usually pop up in American movies (or the Chinese and Japanese that pop up in Chinese and Japanese movies, respectively).<br /><br />The ethnicity of the two main characters, Harold Lee (John Cho), an investment banker, and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn), who is avoiding going to medical school, matters because while these pair are stoners, they are the two smartest stoners in the history of American cinema. Yes, I know, the bar is set pretty low in the first place in that regard, but these guys are really smart. They are both college graduates, Harold has a real job in the real world involving making real money and Kumar has perfect MCAT scores, which explains why he can perform surgery is the situation requires it. Of course the first-time writing team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are not Asian-American, so I cannot go so far as to argue there is a concerted political statement being made here, but in terms of playing with an ethnic stereotype this works pretty well. Besides, any excuse to make the lead characters in a movie like this something more than dope smoking idiots is always going to be a good thing.<br /><br />This film is in the great tradition of "Dude, Where's My Car?" and "The Lord of the Rings," which is to say that "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" is a quest film. The title characters are already high when a White Castle commercial comes on and suddenly the most important thing in the world is getting a bag of the mini-burgers to scarf down. However, this requires getting in a car and driving to the closest White Castle, which is not in the same town. In fact, exactly where the closest White Castle is becomes a major problem in the film, which makes sense because otherwise it ends up being about an hour shorter. In between getting into Harold's car and finding the Promised Land there are a gang of skateboarders, an entire department of racist cops, a tow truck driver with serious genetic problems, and, best of all, Neil Patrick Harris (Neil Patrick Harris).<br /><br />I can appreciate Harold and Kumar's situation in terms of trying to find a White Castle because I thought we had one in our town and we did, but it has since closed. So my plan to have the kids pick up White Castles to eat while watching the film, admittedly not the most original idea in the world for this one, was thwarted. But there was talk about driving 70 miles to where we know there is a White Castle and if it was not for the fact that the movie would have been over by the time whoever made the trip came back with cold burgers we might have considered it. So someone was sent out for tacos instead, which made no sense for watching a movie starring a pair of Asian-Americans, so we ate the tacos without watching the movie (No, when I watched the movie I did not eat Oriental food either, so the whole logic here fell apart completely).<br /><br />Director Danny Leiner did "Dude, Where's My Car?" and the parallels between the two become really obvious once Harold's car gets stolen by the actor who played Doogie Howswer (playing himself). But this movie really is twice as good. Is it because Leiner learned from his mistakes the first time around? Is it because writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are twice as good as Philip Stark (who at least had the "Pink Eye" episode of "South Park" on his resume)? Is it because John Cho and Kal Penn are twice the actors Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott happen to be?<br /><br />Now, that last one I am pretty sure I can quantify, because Cho and Penn do a great job of keeping these characters real and quite different from what we usually find in such films, but I keep coming back to the ethnicity of the two stars, although the film does not go overboard on the Asian stereotypes (there is a scene where Harold has to deal with a group of other Korean-Americans that could be right out of "Gilmore Girls"). Would this film be as funny if the two leads were something other than Asian-American? It really matters that these two guys are smart and the film takes advantage of the stereotype that Asian-Americans are smart to make that point. Lots of stoners have been obsessed with the quest for weed and a bad case of the munchies, but Kumar is smarter than all of them put together, which makes his dream world involving a giant bag of pot that much funnier. Then there is Harold and his quest to at least speak to Maria (Paula Garces), the beautiful girl he keeps meeting in the elevator in his apartment building.<br /><br />The other way in which "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" goes against type in the stoner movie genre is that there is actually a sense of personal growth for the boys after their experience. In this case the film is much more reminiscent of "The Lord of the Rings" than "Dude, Where's My Car?" You do not expect stoners to grow up at the end of their quest (you expect them to spend all their reward money getting Van Halen to play at their birthday party), which just gets us back to the ethnicity of Harold and Kumar. It is rather difficult to walk that kind of a tightrope in a comedy (see "White Chicks"), but this film manages to do it. It will also absolutely cure you of ever wanting to sneak into the girl's bathroom in a college dorm.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>This movie really made me want to eat white castle.

And just to get to a place called White Castle, they would pay a price worth well more than the burgers.<br /><br />Two stoner friends Harold and Kumar(John Cho, and Kal Penn) who are ironicly smart, at first had problems getting blazed but came up with a way to get stoned.  But they wanted the "perfect food"  After watching a white castle advertisment, they decided that was the way.  But on this night, they find out White castle was moved out of it's regular location as told by a Burger Shack emplyee(Anthony Anderson).  But that's not the only roadblock, as Kumar's need for weed, and Harold's fear for a beautiful girl, Maria(Paula Garc&eacute;s) would cause a bit of jagged edges on their journey.  The question is, will they get what they want, or will fate screw them over?<br /><br />The comedy in this film is just flat out genious.  The director(Danny Leiner, and it's hard to believe this is the same director of dude where's my car) does a excellent job of turning usally tragic roadblocks too sheer comedy genious.  Alot of things from a game of battle$#!^$, to riding Cheetas, this is one hysterical movie.  The only things I disliked was looking at Freakshow.  It was funny, but the boils almost made me loose my lunch.  And the extreeme punks werent all that funny, unless they were the ones getting picked on.  The extras are alos excellent, and a bit hysterical as well.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar go to white castle is definitly a hilarious movie about how a normally planed night can get shot up like a target.

Odysseus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140268863">The Odyssey</a> fought monsters and suitors alike, just trying to get home.  A group of Englishmen and women, seeking the grave of a Holy Martyr that helped them when they were sick, take a pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140424385">Canterbury</a>.  A young hobbit bites off more than he can chew when he takes the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618517650">One Ring</a> to Mount Doom.  And now... Harold and Kumar go to white castle.<br /><br />Okay, now that I got the dramatic intro out of my system, here goes the review.  "Harold and Kumar" is very much THAT movie that you can watch with your friends over and over.  There are a bunch of laughs, a fairly simple yet effective story, and constant "I can't believe they took it so far" moments.  This is one of those movies where it's pretty much exactly what you expect it to be.  The higher you are when you watch it, the higher your enjoyment will be.  It's light enough to be rewatchable.  And, most obviously, it'll give you The Crave.<br /><br />So it is what it is.  It's a funny movie that requires zero audience involvement and offers a lot of laughs.  Although the silly moments are a bit too silly and the sweet moments are a bit too sweet, there are a lot of good bits that make this a movie that's probably worth owning on DVD.  If you're looking for something to watch with your friends on a lazy night, this is a good choice.<br /><br />7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>We have all known that feeling: wanting a particular meal, unwilling to rest until we get it. Those of us who attended college will attest to the fact that after you smoke, a certain urge will soon overtake you.  An urge to gorge yourself on some random food that may otherwise disgust you. Harold and Kumar are overtaken by this feeling and they are willing to do whatever it takes to get that food (in this case, White Castle) into their stomachs.<br /><br />During their quest, they encounter a host of hilarious characters. Their neighbors- Goldstein & Rosenberg, the Xtreme crew, Brad the business-suave hippie, the taco-sh** girls, Freakshow, the racist cop, Tarik the cellmate, Doogie Howser! Neil Patrick Harris makes one of the funniest cameo appearances I've ever seen. It will completely ruin any innocent memories you may have had about Doogie, the boy doctor.<br /><br />I thought this movie was hilarious... The story is almost arbitrary, as the characters are so funny, it wouldn't really matter what the point of the movie was. It's also cool that it all takes place along the New Jersey Turnpike, because I actually went to school along the same stretch of road. New Jersey residents will have an added appreciation for the adventure for that reason.  But, whatever state you live in, you should be able to relate to aspects of both characters' personalities. Harold is responsible and "grown-up", while Kumar is a free spirit who doesn't seem to give a damn about anything. They make for a very funny pairing, even though we've all seen it before.<br /><br />There is a ton of great bonus material on this DVD edition. The extended/deleted scenes are awesome and the featurettes and interviews are also entertaining.  It's worth checking it all out, most definitely.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who enjoy ridiculous and filthy humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>I generally find this genre ridiculous, but this film is kinda silly but fun.

Mmmm, mmmm.  Can't you just taste them?<br /><br />They meet lots of colorful characters, and you know this is just a 90 minute excuse to watch them chase after pot all over New Jersey.<br /><br />I loved this movie, and laughed hard at the gross and super funny humor.<br /><br />I would recommend it.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I just bought this movie, I loved it.

Naturally, they get sidetracked along the way with all kinds of characters and dilemmas. Uptight Harold (John Cho) and  happy-go-lucky Kumar (Kal Penn) are a Cheech and Chong for the 21st Century.  Kind of crude but the guys are easy to like and work very well off each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>This movie is about 2 friends who get stoned and get the munchies. So they see a commercial for White Castle and decide they have to have 20 or so burgars each. It turns into a big long adventure though as one thing goes wrong after another. They pick up a hitchhikeer played by Neil Patrick Harris "Doogie Houser, Starship Troopers" who plays Neil Patrick Harris. He's crazy and horny and steals their car so he could go find some women.<br /><br />  Also along the way they meet a bunch of  other crazy weirdos. There's 2 other people you might recognize besides Neil Patrick Harris. Jamie Kennedy (Scream, Son of the Mask) plays a guy who chooses the same bushes to pee behind as Kumar. Also Ryan Reynolds (Blade 3) plays a doctor who hits on Kumar.  The movie is often crude, disgusting with many weed jokes, but it actually doesn't suck. It's pretty funny and not as lame  as you would think a movie would be that's about a trip to White Castle. The director of Dude Where's my Car doesn't mind doing something silly and unusual and he's good at it. This movie I think is much better than Dude Where's My Car though. It actually makes me look forward to his next movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>This movie had a couple of funny parts, but basically<br /><br />it sucked.

It's not great (nobody there is claiming to be a gourmet chef), but it gets the job done.<br /><br />"Harold & Kumar" works in a similar fashion. Another stoner-buddy comedy (owing as much to Cheech and Chong as it does to Chapelle's "Half-Baked"), this movie takes the road-trip/quest concept (which, as the title suggests, is essentially just one huge plug for the fast food chain) and uses it as an excuse to string together a series of sketches on weed, women, and ... racism?<br /><br />The movie is chock full of stereotypes, but don't worry; they're so self-aware that they do everything but wink at the audience. From the hyper-religious freak (who happens to have a smokin' hot wife) to the rude and crude eXtreme sports dudes (one of them is actually called "Extreme Sports Punk #1"), we are given something cliched, and then it is spun on its head (the boil-covered religious man turns out to be big on group sex; the eXtreme sports dudes ... well ... they have interesting taste in music). If there's one thing about "Harold and Kumar" that works, it is its happy subversiveness.<br /><br />But is it funny?<br /><br />That's hard to gauge sometimes, especially when you're talking about a movie that relies so heavily on boob shots. Harold and Kumar, in addition to being hungry for bite-sized, steam-cooked burgers, are also always up for a toke (in fact, their Castle quest is inspired by the munchies), but these guys don't ever really seem all that high (a state of mind which would give more credibility to this weed-obsessed movie). Instead, they're actually pretty smart and clear-headed. On the other hand, the rest of the film is SO cartoonish and weird (vengeful cops, placaple cheetahs, college chicks who play grotesque toilet games) that the gags only work about as much as a typical Bugs Bunny joke, if Bugs had a joint in his mouth instead of a carrot. Granted, Bugs is pretty funny, but only when he's not trying to make a point.<br /><br />In the same way, this movie is spot-on when, like Bugs, it goes for the wistfully irreverent (e.g. Anthony Anderson's wistful and blustering Burger Shack employee), the playfully vindictive (e.g. Neil Patrick Harris as himself-on-E), or the just plain absurd (e.g. Jamie Kennedy's hilarious cameo as a creepy guy in the woods). It's all well and good that the movie wants to make a point (or two), but instead of going for the hazy epiphany (like stoners are wont to do), this flick should've just stuck with the giggles and the bloodshot eyes.<br /><br />This DVD comes with a plethora of special features. Highlights include the deleted scenes (some of which aren't bad at all), and the outtakes (which are good as well, but a little short).</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>i watched this film recently&was cracking up in certain spots. it was cool how the Cast wasn't predictable&this film had a freshness about it. certain things wear it down in spots,but on a whole it was cool for some laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>ACTUAL RATING: 3-1/2 stars (come on, Amazon, give us the halves!)<br /><br />This is like a dumbed down American Pie (star John Cho is an alumnus of that film). It's stupid, juvenile, about as deep as a puddle, contains loads of jokes recycled from other slob comedies, and will stick with you about as long as a Big Mac and fries from MacDonalds (sorry, White Castle). However, the film does have a undeniable spirit of fun and there are some genuine big laughs throughout. It's certainly never boring. The producers clearly didn't intend to make another Schindler's List. They set out to make an enjoyable, entertaining romp and, to that end, they succeeded in spades.<br /><br />NOTE: I really hope, for Neil Patrick Harris' sake, that this isn't the best role he can get these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>If you liked movies like, "Road Trip," "Dude Where's My Car," "Orange County," than this film might be up your alley.  Harold and Kumar seem a bit old for their high schoolish behaviour.  As of films forementioned, and even like classics like "Ferris Buellers Day Off," Harold is the reluctant friend who is dragged along on Kumars antics.  There trip to White Castles is thwarted when they find out that their beloved White Castles closed down years prior.  So the road trip to the White Castles in Cherry Hill begins (coincidently when I lived in South Jersey I loved visiting a White Castles but I think that was in Pennsauken but maybe it was Cherry Hill).  Kumar is all about getting high, and scoring with hot chicks. Harold is into his work and seemingly reluctant to the evenings adventures. He has a sensitive side, "Pretty In Pink" is his favorite movie.  The fact that they are Asian and Indian really is a non issue because Kumar especially acts like a suburban raised white guy. Like alot of other stoner/teen movies, Kumar's dad expects a lot of him and his dad pressures him to go to medical school and not be such a slacker.  I guess the point is to prove that Asian Americans and Indian Americans cool too.  The film is funny at points but it's also quite ridiculous and it's not supposed to make much sense.  It's an okay film I guess, but trust me, you've seen all of this before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>This next month just might even make you hungary, it is Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. And it just might you want to run itno White Castle's, expect for there you have to buy more then one burger to even fill you up, their burgers are little, and I have no idea how they start out like that, you may even need 5 burgers to fill you up but if you have an extreme hungar you might need more then that, The burgers at McDonald's, Burger King, Culver's and Wendy's are just enough to get one, but sometimes you might even like a 2nd one. And White Castle's slogan is "What you crave", and don't you might hate it if you tv knows what you are thinking? We meet Harold (John Cho) at work, he works as an account, and he gets handed more worker from co-workers, who pretend they have a big metting to get off to, just so they can leave and meet the ladies. While his roomate and best friend Kumar (Kal Penn) is at an intreview for medical school with a dean (Fred Willard). So when he does return home, he is meet by Maria (Paula Garces), whom lives on the same floor, in an apartment. He cathces Kumar in his room, but they are still watch tv with each other. Not like he is mad with him, but some of Harold gets hungray, but Kumar suggesting something not delierved, and something they haven't had in a while, and then they see a commerical for White Castle. So they decided to take over, and Harold knows that there is a burger king across town, not to far away near a movie theatre, expect for when they get there, they find a burger shack there, and they check out what happened to White Castle, and they get a tip from the drive threw guy, that there is another White Castle, in Cherry Hill that is about 45 minutes away, so they make the trip, but there places to go and characters to meet before they can get to the White Castle location.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This is a silly film.  It doesn't pretend to be anything groundbreaking, but it's not particularly funny.  It has a few choice moments (especially Neil Patrick Harris's turn as himself), but overall it's rather dull, and the stoner genre was covered much better with Cheech and Chong.  A few critics (Roger Ebert, especially) thought that this was an important (!) film, because the lead characters were Asian and Indian, and that it was historically signficant because of casting ethnic minorities.  That theory is actually funnier than the movie itself.  This is a really ordinary stoner flick.  The fact that the 2 main characters aren't white doesn't make the film important or groundbreaking (please!).  Cheech is Mexican, and Chong is part Chinese, so was Up in Smoke a groundbreaking film?  No!  Up in Smoke was about two stoners, and so is this one.  For the record, Up in Smoke is light years funnier than this film.  This film is nothing special, but it has no pretensions on being a boundary shattering film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle" is a stoner comedy that tries to distinguish itself with ethnic lead characters instead of being a typical white guy buddy picture. Harold (John Cho) is a Korean investment banker frustrated with his job. And Kumar (Kal Penn) will do anything to avoid going to medical school, as his parents expect. They are recent college graduates and roommates whose idea of a good time is watching tv while getting high. One evening while doing just that, Harold and Kumar get a craving for White Castle burgers. So, stoned out of their minds, the pair set out in search of pot, women, and an elusive White Castle restaurant.<br /><br />A more descriptive, but no less blunt, title for the movie might be "Vulgar Adventures on the Way to White Castle". The humor here is low-brow, scatological, literally "potty humor". Harold and Kumar are a couple of stoned, socially unsophisticated young men. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, but I think the comedy is undermined by the guys' more preposterous escapades. A couple of stoners taking the most indirect route possible in an obsessive pursuit of hamburgers is funny without turning it into a circus sideshow. Funnier, in fact. As stoner comedies go, this one just doesn't rate very high. I recommend 1999's superb film "Go" as an example of how funny and frustrating a quest for recreational pharmaceuticals can be.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 3 audio commentaries, 8 deleted/alternate scenes plus outtakes, 2 theatrical trailers, a music video for "Yeah (Dream of Me) by All Too Much, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). "John Cho and Kal Penn: The Backseat Interview" (12 minutes) is an interview of the two lead actors by comedian Bobby Lee, who has a small part in the film. They talk about various scenes in the movie while driving around Los Angeles in an SUV in the rain. "The Art of the Fart" (10 minutes) is about creating the sound for the bathroom competition between the 2 English coeds. Includes interviews with director Danny Leiner and Sound Designer Jeff Kushner. "Cast and Crew: Drive-Thru Bites" is a series of short interviews with director Danny Leiner, the actresses who play the "diarrhea twins", one of the extreme sports punk actors, the neighboring roommates, writers Hurwitz and Schlossberg, actor Fred Willard, actor Neil Patrick Harris, and  Paula Garces, who plays Maria. "A Trip to the Land of Burgers" (10 minutes) is about creating the film's single animated sequence, Harold's dream. One of the theatrical trailers is approved for all audiences by the MPAA; the other is rated R.<br /><br />The first audio commentary is by director Danny Leiner and actors John Cho and Kal Penn. Leiner talks about decisions and difficulties in making the film, and Cho and Penn talk about their on-set experiences. The second audio commentary is by writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, accompanied by their friend, Harold Lee, who was the inspiration for the movie's Harold character. Hurwitz and Schlossberg were roommates and wrote the film about characters like themselves and their friends. They discuss writing and storytelling decisions, casting, and their experiences on the set during filming and in getting the movie made. Theirs is the most interesting of the audio commentaries. The third audio commentary is an "Extreme" commentary by actor Danny Bochart, who played one of the extreme sports punks. It's a rambling but good-natured commentary on how he got the role and about the movie. Bochart is a skateboarder in Toronto with no prior film experience, who was cast much to his own surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Even though I enjoyed watching "Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle," I don't feel that it deserves more than three stars.  Some of the scenes in this flick are hilarious, but most of the movie just seems to plod along between those scenes.<br /><br />It starts out easy enough, Harold("American Pie's" John Cho) is your average Asian intelligent guy stuck in a deadend job.  He gets walked on by his co-workers and is stuck doing their work for the evening.  His roommate, the underachieving screw-up, Kumar(the Indian kid in "Van Wilder"), just wants to live life on the Mary Jane plane.  The two roomies end up sharing some weed and then deciding to venture out to White Castle to grab some grub.  What happens after that is a ton of racially stereotyped jokes, literal bathroom humor, weed humor, and Doogie Howser, M.D.<br /><br />Like I said before, this flick has its moments.  Neil Patrick Harris nearly steals the show by playing himself.  A run in with a cheetah is also very funny.  However, this film continuously stalled between the fun parts.<br /><br />What you have in the end is an "Odd Couple"-like buddy flick where the main characters are a bit likeable, but not quite funny enough.  I'd rent this one before I'd buy it, but chances are that if you do watch this flick with a little weed in your system, you'll think that this is the greatest film ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Harold, played by John Cho (Better Luck Tomorrow) and Kumar, played by Kal Penn (Van Wilder) are watching TV and see a commerical on the best tasting burgers ever made from a place called White Castle. The commercial gets them so hungry that they set out on a trip to go find the White Castle and satisfy their craving, only to wind up being caught off course from strange encounters with other people. You'd have to be high and maybe of taken two hits of acid to of liked this scattershot comedy yet again about two friends and it was directed by the guy who brought the stupid Dude, Where's My Car? to the big screen.....big surprise..not. The hilarious thing in this movie was the scenes with Neil Patrick Harris (Starship Troopers,  Doogie Houser) in them....when he was tripping out on E in the back seat of the 2 buddies vehicle and when the 2 buddies finally make it to White Castle, he is there because they talked about the place so much they gave him a craving for the tasty burgers as well.

Had it just stuck with the cheese-o-rama approach and showed high-ons cavorting through the night it would have warranted three stars and a smile, but it kept forcing some bogus social consciousness into the story. Disappointingly, this film has an all-too-predictable politically correct edge to it.  All of the white characters, and I mean all of them, from the snowboard dudes to the cop, are offensive and racist; whereas, all of "people of color" are good.  It's absolutely ridiculous and reaches a low point when Harold runs into a guy who's in jail for "being black."  Yawn.  Come on, make a movie about slackers about slackers and not about some half-wit trendy ideology steeped in bashing whitey.  Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda should not be the target audience for a film with a premise like this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>In the past, "stoner" movies used to be somewhat funny, but this one... I wouldn't even call it a stoner movie, it was about 2 guys who get stoned and decide to go Whitecastle, and on the way, everything goes wrong.<br /><br />I got a few small laughs here and there, but nothing memorable in the end. The only thing I remember about the movie now is Bobby Lee from Mad TV is in it, but that's no reason to watch it.<br /><br />If you wanna watch a stupid movie where after a night out of a couple of baked guys go looking for the munchies and all of a sudden the next day they have enough confidence to stand up for themselves, or ask a chick out at last, then this ones gonna knock your socks off.<br /><br />It is refreshing to not see the Chinese-eyes guy laughing on the sofa watching Ren & Stimpy for a change, but I think I just had my hopes set too high on what I expected from this movie. It had potentiality to do some great comedy moments, but nothing was there. It needed something in it to make it stand out from the others, like if you can't remember the name of a movie, you might say, "oh remember that film where the chick had the sperm in her hair?" or "The movie where the guy bends over and starts talking from his butt?" or "that flick where the guys at the 7-11 pull out the guns on the robbers and tell 'em not to call them Pakistani" ya know, what did this movie have? "oh it's that film that... the two guys get the munchies and.... the party.... ummm.... there car was.... the girl ... the ... screw it, lets watch Cheech & Chong, man"</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>After watching this film I checked online to see how much this film cost to be made.  Normally, I do not do this, but upon seeing this movie I had to see where all the money went.  When I discovered that it cost nine million dollars to create, I was flabbergasted.  Where did they put all the money?  For those that argue that the money is in the production, I would beg to differ.  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle was one of the worst productions that I have ever seen.  Even for a pre-teen comedy, it continually felt fake and "sound-staged" instead of fun and humorous.  You could tell, from scene to scene, which ones actually involved Harold and Kumar being out in the real world and those that were created in a Hollywood studio.  The infamous green-screen was very apparent in nearly 80% of the film, giving us that impression that not much was spent to make this a quality picture.  Again, I ask, where did the nine million go?<br /><br />The acting was average.  You are not dealing with comedy heavy hitters in this film, but instead two actors that gained some popularity due to films that actually spent their money on production, American Pie and Van Wilder.  While I will admit that both of these films stand on their own two feet, I cannot agree that Harold and Kumar does the same.  The acting hurt the comedy, which ultimately hurt the film as a whole.  I think what hurt the actors directly were the apparent lack of character development that was so desperately needed to find these guys funny.  I think I may have laughed a bit more at their jokes if I knew who they were and what pressures that they were feeling in life to get to where they currently are in life.  The brief seconds at the beginning of the film just didn't cut it for me.  For those that claim that they are just "stoners", I would have to argue that they are more.  Their high spirits and sense of fun does not come from smoking weed, but because they are not challenged in life and desperately seek adventure.  That is who I saw in this film, not just stoners, but adventurers that needed their quest.  Sadly, I do not think the general population saw this because of the crass humor, the cheapened production values, and overall the lack of defined acting by John Cho and Kal Penn).  Do I need to ask where the nine million dollars went again?!?<br /><br />Aside from the horrible acting by our guides, and the funnier parts of the film coming from our side performers like Jamie Kennedy and Ryan Reynolds, the jokes just didn't seem like they worked for the most part.  The Neil Patrick Harris scenes felt as if they were placed in the film just to be "cool" and to resurrect a struggling actor that had some success as a child.  I didn't capture the full purpose that the director went with Harris because the budget was NINE MILLION DOLLARS!  Another actor could have been funnier, but instead Harris was called upon to grope women and provide some of the unfunnier moments.  The girls in the bathroom scene were uncalled for and definitely lacked the actual comedy appeal.  Perhaps I am getting to old, but I desire more films like Van Wilder that relies heavily on the sharp tongue of the main actor instead of amateurish humor.  I continually felt that the director used over used techniques of past teen comedies to monopolize his film and make himself some cash.  He was not being creative, but instead repetitive, and it hurt this film.<br /><br />Finally, I need to bring up the production values again, especially near the end of the film where it became apparent that money had run dry and the green-screen effect needed to be used and abused.  You could tell that you were on a set and not actually following two twenty-something on their adventure.  This completely ruined my sense of fun for this film.  With a nine million-dollar budget, could they not get actual shots of these two driving in a real car?  To me, we moved past that technique in the early 60s, and we do not need to repeat it for this feature.  I felt cheated watching this film, wondering where my money and Hollywood's money went, thinking that perhaps the director is lighting his own weed with $100 bills while enjoying his free samples from White Castle since they used the name in the film.  Cheapened production values is what soured this film for me.<br /><br />Overall, I was high disappointed in this film.  With fresh thoughtful comedies being released everyday that actually use your mind and intelligence to make you laugh, this film resorted to last-years trend (already too dated) of bathroom humor and nudity to make their characters likeable and work.  Cho and Penn need to work a bit harder on some supporting roles before making another big jump, which in this case was very premature.  The supporting stars in this film had a chance to shine through and they took it proving that Ryan Reynolds could be the next Chevy Chase and Jamie Kennedy is funny.  Outside of this, I am still seeking an answer to the age-old riddle of where the NINE MILLION-DOLLAR budget disappeared to!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Ok so we have an Asian and a dark skinned Indian who enjoy smoking weed. Does this sound somewhat familiar? How about a half-Chinese and a Mexican who did this same kind of comedy 30 years ago? LIke most of the stuff that Hollywood cranks out these days, nothing is original.<br /><br />So OK we have two dudes smoking weed on a Friday night and they get the munchies. They decide to go to White Castle and finally arrive Saturday morning. Deep plot huh?<br /><br />I think any movie that has Patrick Neil Harris playing himself is in trouble from the get go. To see him snort a line of coke off a girl's bare behind while standing in a speeding car is just disturbing. You've certainly come a long way Doctor Doogie.<br /><br />Our heros also get a ride in a tow truck from the Christian man of 1000 boils, together they ride a cheetah bareback, try to score weed at Princeton University, and learn about the special sauce at a competing burger joint.<br /><br />The gags are OK and it is good for a few laughs here and there, but I don't think these two are going to be the next dynamic duo of the weed comedy genre. They were pretty forgetable. They just didn't seem to have much personality, espescially the Asian guy.<br /><br />If you got nothing to do, go ahead and watch it sometime. I doubt it'll become your favorite comedy, but it's a good 90 minutes spent if you're watching it for the first time.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This is a movie about two guys who love to do drugs and, while high, develop a craving for a certain fast food burger.

Lived there all my life, and if there's one delicacy that cannot be found anywhere else, It's the WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER. I salivate just thinking about it.<br /><br /> And there I was in the Hollywood Hills craving one. I went down to the little store that was in my Apartment complex and there they were Frozen White Castle's just waiting to be devoured. I greedily bought a box and was in Heaven for a small moment as I savored them.<br /><br /> Cut to the present. A weird promotional pack shows up on my desk at work. It's for a movie called HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE. It also featured a map of their intrepid Journey from New Brunswick, NJ to Cherry Hill, NJ to get the sweet nectar that is a WHITE CASTLE hamburger. I was intrigued. Here was the kind of movie that, if done well, could keep me happy for weeks and craving those awesome burgers.<br /><br /> HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE star Kal Penn (Van Wilder) and John Cho (American Wedding) as two stoner's with the munchies. It just so happens that a White Castle commercial is on TV, so they decide to go. Little do they know that they're about to go on the Road Trip of a life time.<br /><br /> Man am I mad. This is a great premise for a movie. Unlike some, I always liked the road movie, because I like the weird characters the characters met. I also like when basic concepts are blown completely out of proportion. Plus it's set in Jersey, that's always a good thing. HAROLD AND KUMAR tries to give you weird and wacky characters, and it tries to make a small concept into a high concept and fails in the attempt.<br /><br /> Come on people, New Jersey is one of the Strangest states in the Union. Don't believe me, check out WEIRDNJ.COM. A magazine the chronicles the states local legends and wild characters. The state is a character in and of itself. Between the Jersey Devil, The Klan and Satanists in the woods, the best they could come up with was Jamie Kennedy peeing in a bush? or Doogie Howser stealing a car? Every joke felt like a cop out, there is nothing of value in this truly stupid film except for Christopher Meloni's Freakshow. Now he was funny.<br /><br /> (As a side note, there is no such thing as SELF-SERVE GAS in NJ. So to put a sign up at a gas station that says Self Serve in this movie is just stupid.)<br /><br /> Director Danny Leiner hasn't learned the lessons of DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? The same regurgitated joke over and over does not a funny movie make and just because your movie is successful doesn't mean its good. HAROLD AND KUMAR, like DUDE is full of potentially funny stuff, and yet plays better on paper than on the screen.<br /><br /> For instance I think it's funny to read in a screenplay &quot;and Doogie Howser steals a car&quot;. But to watch it on the screen, you say so what? There is potential comedy there but no payoff. I'll bet they had a lot of fun making this movie, but probably gasped when they saw the final product.<br /><br /> Of course I didn't walk into this movie thinking that it was the second coming of CITIZEN KANE. But I walked in hoping to laugh A LOT and I didn't. You can make a stupid, vapid, piece of camp (or crap), but if it's not funny, it's not worth the time or effort. Danny Leiner you wasted my time, you wasted the studio's money, and you should be horrified by your crappy movie.<br /><br /> HAROLD AND KUMAR is like the feeling you get after you've finished a couple dozen WHITE CASTLE'S, your stomach aches and you say to yourself &quot;man I shouldn't have done that&quot;. You then spend the rest of the afternoon on the toilet. Do me favor go to the restaurant enjoy the burgers and skip the movie. You'll be happy you did.<br /><br /> *1/2 (out of 5)</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Wow, this movie sucks.

However, the newspapers and web sites gave it good reviews, so I started to warm up to the concept of seeing it.  When I did, I was pleasantly surprised not only at the humor, but at the intelligence of the film (the humor was what I was expecting, but I actually found it funny).<br /><br />Harold Lee (John Cho) is a Junior Investment Banker while his best friend and roommate Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) is (not) trying to get into med school.  Harold is a little uptight and repressed, while Kumar is very easygoing.  The two also enjoy marijuana.  So one night, the pair gets high and gets the munchies, and they decide to go to White Castle.  Along the way, they run into nearly every imaginable setback (flat tire, getting lost, stolen car), as well as some unimaginable ones (Harold gets knocked out while riding a cheetah).  They also encounter a bevy of interesting people along the way.  At Princeton, Harold runs into an Asian girl who has a crush on him named Cindy Kim (Siu Ta), who refers to him as a "Twinkie" (yellow on the outside, white on the inside).  Meanwhile, Kumar meets a "business hippie" (Dov Tiefenbach) and two very hot girls who make a game out... well I'll let you find out.  They meet Freakshow (Christopher Meloni), a hideous mechanic who says that, while he fixes their car, Harold and Kumar are welcome to sleep with his supermodel wife.  There are a group of racist bullies as well as racist cops, Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, I mean himself) and finally, Harold's love interest, Maria Quesa Dilla (Paula Garc&eacute;s).<br /><br />One of the great intellectual points lies in the title and plot: why are they going to White Castle of all places?  It contains the word white.  Even though the pair are ethnic, and are often attacked for their minority status, they are white inside.  They live in the American melting pot, and they are no different from the people who give them a hard time.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this movie is actually very entertaining.  If gross-out humor isn't your thing, you should avoid it, otherwise, go for it.  It's extreme dude!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>If you are easily offended by jokes about casual drug use and promiscuous sex, you may want to avoid "Harold and Kumar Go to White Caste," a comedy dedicated to the noble causes of reckless driving, uninhibited gluttony and unbridled flatulence as well.  If, however, these topics don`t offend you, then you may find yourself enjoying this raucous, riotous and high-spirited tale of two young potheads who take to the road in pursuit of the world's greatest hamburger.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar are two young men desperate to overcome the burden of their respective ethnic stereotypes.  Harold is a shy, introverted Korean businessman who wants to be anything but a shy, introverted Korean businessman.  Kumar, a young, twenty-three year old Indian, has opted to become a slacker, mainly as a way of rebelling against the future his high-pressured dad has mapped out for him (being an "Indian doctor" like his far-more-ambitious older brother).  One Friday night, bonged out of their minds and desperate to find a way to satisfy their "munchies," Harold and Kumar decide to go on a quest for the stoner's holy grail - White Castle hamburgers, of course.  As they traverse the wilds of northern New Jersey, our two illustrious compatriots undergo a series of bizarre and often surrealistic misadventures that give them a night neither of them will ever forget.<br /><br />As stated before, the humor in "Harold and Kumar" is crass, crude, vulgar and epicene.  It is also clever, good-natured and downright hilarious, with a little satirical bite thrown in from time to time to keep the higher thinkers in the crowd entertained.  John Cho and Kal Penn make a great comic team as Harold and Kumar and the other actors are all fine as well.  Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) makes an appearance playing himself, showing that he's a game player when it comes to engaging in a little good-natured ribbing at his own expense.<br /><br />Although "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" is not likely to earn the Concerned Parents of America Seal of Approval, that's no reason why the rest of us can't just sit back, buckle up and enjoy the trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie, while it does seem to perpetuate the stoner's image in society, does provide a few laughs for those who can stand it's plot lines predictability. Although it does follow the same plot line as one of the films by the same director ("Dude Where's My Car"), it is lovable and the characters don't learn too many lessons. THANK the writers...There is no big moral and they don't sicken you with too much character growth. Go see the movie. Don't expect it to change you life, just expect to be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This will probably hit the funny bone of more guys than women, but that said it has some hysterical moments. Two guys have taken their share of abuse because of their races but life has a way of evening things out. Harold is an accountant that gets taken advantage of by his co-workers. Kumar is gifted at medicine but can't seem to take the responsibility of getting a job.<br /><br />When Harold and Kumar decide to kick back one Friday night and smoke some pot it seems like any other weekend. Then while watching a commercial for White Castle's they decide they have to pig out on "Sliders". Their journey to get there is one of those that enters the annuls of all time great road trip movies. As they start their trip it seems that what was going to be a short trip to the mall ends up bumping into parties, a wild racoon, a beating, performing surgery, fast food store, jail, Doogie Houser, and a host of other encounters.<br /><br />Fans of road trip movies like "Fandango", "Dumb and Dumber", "Road Trip", et cetera will want to catch this one. Good picture and sound and some funny extras to boot. If you like comedy you will want to buy this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>After best buds Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) partake in some herbal refreshment one night, the pair decide to cure their munchies fix with a visit to White Castle.  This is the premise for Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, and while it's hardly anything on paper, the film manages to be better and funnier than one would expect it to be.  Along the way, they encounter a twisted fast food employee (Anthony Anderson), an inbred tow truck driver (Law & Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni), and even Neil Patrick Harris, whose performance and delivery are so off the wall it must be seen to be believed.  It wears thin towards the end, but for the most part Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is a very funny buddy/stoner comedy with a touch of social commentary and mild homophobia to boot.  As long as you don't take it seriously, you'll enjoy it, and by the time it's over, you'll be craving some White Castle too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Warning!  If you are not a fan of drug humor, toilet humor, or frat humor, you will hate this movie.  Along the lines of 'Dude, Where's My Car', this little sleeper comedy had me laughing so hard I almost split.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar are roommates.  After toking up, they decide they want the perfect food and head out to go to White Castle burgers.  (Anybody besides me remember White Castle?  Nastiest burgers in the world!)  Harold has work to do, having a project dumped on him at quitting time by a co-worker.  Kumar, after making a mess of one interview for med school, has another interview set up by his father for 10AM the following morning.  But nothing will stop these two from reaching the perfect food.<br /><br />Their night turns into one mishap after another, tollbooths, cheetahs, a gang of 'Extreme' skateboarders, a crazy Burger Shack employee, a racist cop, a jail breakout, a Princeton party, two pretty girls with bad bathroom habits, Doogie Houser MD (Neil Patrick Harris), and a crazy, boil-infested tow truck driver named Freakshow.<br /><br />John Cho as Harold and Kal Penn as Kumar both display an amazing talent with their characters, even if this movie will never be up for an Academy Award, and my hat goes off to Neil Patrick Harris for his ability to make fun of himself and have some fun while doing it.  Special mention, though, must be given to Christopher Meloni who plays Freakshow. ("Who wants the first reach around?") Meloni proves that no matter how disgusting the character, its important to play it well, and he does so with humor and revolting finesse.<br /><br />Don't miss out on the fantasy scenes either, Kumar's involving falling in love with, and marrying, a bag of weed, and Harold's involving a Chow Yun-Fat/Zorro type encounter with Maria, the girl of his dreams.<br /><br />'Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle' is a silly and pointless comedy with no value whatsoever except to entertain you and make you laugh, and that it will.  While off color, the humor is still sharp, and the pace is just right to keep your stomach hurting all the way through the movie.  I recommend that you pick up the Unrated Extended Edition, or you will miss out on a lot of the better scenes.  Definitely a 'Purchase'.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In the beginning there was "Up in Smoke" with Cheech and Chong.  If that was not the original stoner comedy it is at least the most pertinent reference point for considering "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle," because as a society we have clearly moved from a stoner comedy in 1978 starring a Hispanic-American and an Asian-American to a stoner comedy in 2004 starring a pair of Asian-Americans.  Not only that, but the two young Asian-Americans are a Korean-American and an Indian-American, and not the Chinese-Americans and Japanese-Americans that usually pop up in American movies (or the Chinese and Japanese that pop up in Chinese and Japanese movies, respectively).<br /><br />The ethnicity of the two main characters, Harold Lee (John Cho), an investment banker, and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn), who is avoiding going to medical school, matters because while these pair are stoners, they are the two smartest stoners in the history of American cinema.  Yes, I know, the bar is set pretty low in the first place in that regard, but these guys are really smart.  They are both college graduates, Harold has a real job in the real world involving making real money and Kumar has perfect MCAT scores, which explains why he can perform surgery is the situation requires it.  Of course the first-time writing team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are not Asian-American, so I cannot go so far as to argue there is a concerted political statement being made here, but in terms of playing with an ethnic stereotype this works pretty well.  Besides, any excuse to make the lead characters in a movie like this something more than dope smoking idiots is always going to be a good thing.<br /><br />This film is in the great tradition of "Dude, Where's My Car?" and "The Lord of the Rings," which is to say that "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" is a quest film.  The title characters are already high when a White Castle commercial comes on and suddenly the most important thing in the world is getting a bag of the mini-burgers to scarf down.  However, this requires getting in a car and driving to the closest White Castle, which is not in the same town.  In fact, exactly where the closest White Castle is becomes a major problem in the film, which makes sense because otherwise it ends up being about an hour shorter.  In between getting into Harold's car and finding the Promised Land there are a gang of skateboarders, an entire department of racist cops, a tow truck driver with serious genetic problems, and, best of all, Neil Patrick Harris (Neil Patrick Harris).<br /><br />I can appreciate Harold and Kumar's situation in terms of trying to find a White Castle because I thought we had one in our town and we did, but it has since closed.  So my plan to have the kids pick up White Castles to eat while watching the film, admittedly not the most original idea in the world for this one, was thwarted.  But there was talk about driving 70 miles to where we know there is a White Castle and if it was not for the fact that the movie would have been over by the time whoever made the trip came back with cold burgers we might have considered it.  So someone was sent out for tacos instead, which made no sense for watching a movie starring a pair of Asian-Americans, so we ate the tacos without watching the movie (No, when I watched the movie I did not eat Oriental food either, so the whole logic here fell apart completely).<br /><br />Director Danny Leiner did "Dude, Where's My Car?" and the parallels between the two become really obvious once Harold's car gets stolen by the actor who played Doogie Howswer (playing himself).  But this movie really is twice as good.  Is it because Leiner learned from his mistakes the first time around?  Is it because writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are twice as good as Philip Stark (who at least had the "Pink Eye" episode of "South Park" on his resume)?  Is it because John Cho and Kal Penn are twice the actors Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott happen to be?<br /><br />Now, that last one I am pretty sure I can quantify, because Cho and Penn do a great job of keeping these characters real and quite different from what we usually find in such films, but I keep coming back to the ethnicity of the two stars, although the film does not go overboard on the Asian stereotypes (there is a scene where Harold has to deal with a group of other Korean-Americans that could be right out of "Gilmore Girls").  Would this film be as funny if the two leads were something other than Asian-American?  It really matters that these two guys are smart and the film takes advantage of the stereotype that Asian-Americans are smart to make that point.  Lots of stoners have been obsessed with the quest for weed and a bad case of the munchies, but Kumar is smarter than all of them put together, which makes his dream world involving a giant bag of pot that much funnier.  Then there is Harold and his quest to at least speak to Maria (Paula Garces), the beautiful girl he keeps meeting in the elevator in his apartment building.<br /><br />The other way in which "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" goes against type in the stoner movie genre is that there is actually a sense of personal growth for the boys after their experience.  In this case the film is much more reminiscent of "The Lord of the Rings" than "Dude, Where's My Car?"  You do not expect stoners to grow up at the end of their quest (you expect them to spend all their reward money getting Van Halen to play at their birthday party), which just gets us back to the ethnicity of Harold and Kumar.  It is rather difficult to walk that kind of a tightrope in a comedy (see "White Chicks"), but this film manages to do it.  It will also absolutely cure you of ever wanting to sneak into the girl's bathroom in a college dorm.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>This is one awesome movie. It's about these two asian guys having a bad day and a worse eventful night. They wish to eat burgers at some place called "White Castle" because they saw an advert on tv.There on , its all about their crazy journey. They keep running into wierd people everywhere. I thought the white yuppies were really funny. The best scene in the flick was the one where they actually steal a truck belonging to posers and later sing along to some extremely lame music. I'd recommend this to anyone because it's thoroughly entertaining and funny.<br /><br />I understood the Hindi they spoke at the Indian store and that was a nice feeling.I thought the "Kumar" in the film acted rather well. He was also one of the many supporting actors in "American Desi" which was another funny flick. Harold And Kumar....overtakes all my expectations. I suggest you rent a dvd and try this movie out first before purchasing it.<br /><br />Another must see is a film featuring Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence called "Nothing To Lose".

I agree, if you love movies like American Pie, then you will like this movie. The jokes are funny and the story is not boring. It is also interesting to see how many cameos are in this film, because there are a some. The movie slows down for a little while but picks back up again and finishes with the possibility of a sequel and I think it deserves one.

It's also nice to see these characters aren't pure white goodie goodie boys, they are Asian and Indian.  They are real characters and not a one note underdeveloped joke.

HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE is one few and far between comedy in which you actually laugh out loud, several times even. There are many classic moments like "battle sh*ts", "riding the cheetah" and "Neil Patrick Harris snorting cocaine off a hot babes @ss" ..among others. John Cho & Kal Penn have more chemistry than a chemistry set. They are hilarious together. I hope that director Danny Leiner is planning a HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO AMSTERDAM sequal. It's a must! The DVD features some interesting extras. "The Art of Fart" follows one of the films sound effects members around in truck stops hoping to record the perfect farts and diarrhea sounds for the "battle sh*ts" scene. Also there are some deleted scenes & outtakes. Plus interviews with the films two leads Cho & Penn. Beyond an R rating this DVD is the EXTREME UNRATED version.

They run into a Jesus freak(uh,in a literal sense), they run in to Neil Patrick Harris, and he steals their car. They run into Harold's ex-girlfriend and they wind up in the bathroom with two soroity girls that plan to have sex with them but they play Battle Crap(it is the s-word). So They finally get to the White Castle after a long and weird night. They have a feast fit for kings.<br /><br />This movie is,in a weird sense, brillant. The actors Kal Penn and John Cho make you laugh and carry the entire film on their hands. The guest spots were entirely wasted, the only funny ones was Neil Patrick Harris and Jamie Kennedy. This movie isn't for everyone, it could offend, or gross out, or bother some people. I found it hilarously wonderful. Danny Leiner isn't the greatest director of all time but he shows some funny comedy chops and has a future. I also liked how lot of the jokes worked and they clicked like in some other asnine comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>There are a number of good films in the genre known as the 'stoner movie comedy'. Good examples include "Dazed & Confused" (my personal favorite), "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and of course "Cheech & Chong's classic "Up in Smoke". These films and others like it usually involve severely stoned characters having some pretty hilarious adventures, while being under the influence. But here's something I've never been able to figure out. Why does Hollywood always portray the 'Stoners' as being the most dim witted, moronic people in the room? What if you made a movie, where the 'Stoners' happened to be the smartest people in the room? Well now my question has been answered with the DVD release of the falling down, hilarious film comedy, "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle". In the film we meet our two wiley protaganists of the title, Harold & Kumar. Harold (John Cho) is a staightlaced numbers cruncher for a big securities corporation. The weekend is about to start, but his sleazy boss dumps even more work on him at quitting time. Meanwhile, Harold's love life is on hold, because he's to wimpy to say something to the sexy dream girl, who lives in his apartment building. Harold's best friend is Kumar (Kal Penn), a fast talking smart a**, who is barely going through the motions of looking like he's interested in getting into medical school. Actually his interests are more along the lines of procuring good dope and getting laid. The weekend starts and our two heroes are sitting at home getting 'high as a kite' as they watch "sixteen Candles" on the tube. This naturally leads to a killer case of the 'munchies'. But just the ordinary pizza, Chinese or KFC is not going to do the trick. They need the 'Everest' of junk food, namely 'White Castle's' little tasty Hamburgers (known as 'sliders'). The boys drive off into the night going on their long and insanely funny quest to find these delicious morsels of meat. Along the way they meet up with horny college girls, the Korean Students Assoc., a grotesque trucker & his sexy wife, nasty skinheads, out of control fascist cops, an escaped cheetah and even a drug fueled, hooker obsessed, 'Doogie Howser'! I think, what I like about this film is that it plays out like a live action version of a "Looney Tunes" cartoon . The two main characters are instantly likable. Kumar is like a cross between Bugs Bunny & Groucho Marx, using his fast wit to solve any obstacle or problem. Harold is Kumar's straightman (his Zeppo Marx) constantly staying on the straight and narrow until he's pushed just too far! Together the two have great chemistry together, which is greatly aided by the fast and funny script. Like a good episode of "South Park", this witty movie chooses to make fun of everything and everyone that crosses it's path. It doesn't matter what your ethnic background, religion, sexual preference or occupation is. It's an equal opprutunity offender with hilarious results! The DVD to this film is well put together. It includes, what must be one of the best menu's ever put on DVD. The two lead characters are driving in there car criticizing and making fun of the viewer for not picking the different menu options. It goes on for quite a while and it's really funny! This 'Extreme Unrated' version includes deleted scenes and outtakes, a back seat interview with the actors, commentaries and even a documentary on the making of the 'diarrhea' scene, sound effects! For an evening of great 'stoner comedy' get "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"!

Two minor foreign character stereotypes from other teen films go searching for America's finest, White Castle.  Yeah, it's weak, and honestly a bit better then most in this genre, but still just average overall.<br /><br />  The characters themselves are funny, while the situations are okay.  As expected the adventure leans to the obscene, perverse, and raunchy.  Some like that; however, I was just amazed that the trip was semi-interesting.<br /><br />  Now, I know this is going to be upsetting to read for those who like this type of film, but it is really just average, and probably less.

Cho and Penn have such an appealing rapport that I hope this film developes a deserved cult following so that they may be reunited in future ventures.  Neil Patrick Harris also lampoons his "Doogie Howser" character with hilarious results.  Since I did not see this film in the theatre I would like to know what makes it "the extreme unrated version".  My experience with these discs that tantalize us with the "unrated" tag is that there isn't much verboten in these versions except for a few superfluous scenes that add nothing to the original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle is indeed the plot of the movie; but make no mistake about it-it's a fun movie with some good twists and turns to make the ride fun.

They are harassed by a tough gang, chased by cops, and have a "swell" time with a rabid raccoon.<br /><br />Younger people will have an easy time identifying with Harold and Kumar. It's also great that they include some things about the nastiness of humdrum work days with nasty politics. You wind up routing for the two heroes to get there! The fact that Harold and Kumar are Asian and Indian help flesh out their personalities and idiosyncrasies, too.<br /><br />But there's more! GRIN The DVD is unedited which may make you like it more; but maybe then you might not want to play this when the little ones are around! Doogie Howser, M.D. (Neil Patrick Harris) gets some screen time, and there are cameos by Jamie Kennedy and Ryan Reynolds.<br /><br />If you want to just relax and enjoy a fun movie without having to think too much, this is the movie for you. John Cho and Kal Penn do a great job of playing Harold and Kumar and the action moves swiftly, keeping people entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Not typically my kind of movie, but as mindless entertainment it was actually quite fun.<br /><br />Plotless really except for the standard oddysey road trip, but it is very funny at points and boasts such ridiculously absurd encounters that it is enjoyable.<br /><br />Both actors are fine in their roles and add an extra offbeat dimension to the film.  A new Cheech & Chong?</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>The director of "Dude, where's my car" doesn't seem to have grown up. Good for us! His latest offering once again plops smack in the middle of youthful roadtrip comedies, never taking itself too seriously. No reason then for us to.<br /><br />Its meagre ambitions are limited to a couple of boys' misadventures, as funny as anything playing out these days, which predictably give way to toilet dalliances and other cheap shots that expose the director's craven desire to 'be cool' with the ear-pierced skateboarding crowd.<br /><br />Such ambitions are of course met without much fuss, and despite its scattershot social barbs, the film sports a loose goofball charm that certainly makes it a worthy popcorn getaway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>If you liked the humor in the Revenge of the Nerds movies you should definately like this one.  This movie is so stupid but has some gut-wrenchingly funny parts nonetheless.<br /><br />There are a lot of stereotypes (racial profilers, Indian convenience store guys, etc.) thar are played out well in a humorous way.<br /><br />No matter how far the pair travel, they seem to run into the same people are end up back at some of the same places.  And yes, the movie did make me make a trip to White Castle, where I hadn't been there in a few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>The reviews are in! Who cares what all of the so called reviewers think! They all tend to think too much. (I`ll raise my hand.) Toke up and watch this unrated DVD again. Then write your review over.<br /><br />What did you get? Did it change your mind? Okay, now rewrite!<br /><br />Well now that I'm clear of mind. Harold and Kumar gave me some laughs. In this day an age it seems Hollywood cannot come up with a comedy classic mega hit. Sure there are some good comedic hits to come out recently like "Old School" and "Van Wilder", but nothing that can compare to the vintage "Cheech & Chong", "Animal House" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" classics.<br /><br />Harold & Kumar features male bonding, road trips, fatuitous jokes and of course nudity. Harold (John Cho) is an investment banker. Kumar (Kal Penn) is Harold's roommate. Friday night is smoke night, but the usual fast food delivery just won't work on this night. White Castle's commercial is the only choice (Optimal timing) to satisfy their hunger.  (Hence the road trip.) I say who hasn't had a road trip to a late night fast food joint?<br /><br />(This road trip is totally believable because of mouth watering White Castle's burger. Have you had pleasure of tasting White Castle's sliders? If not, you are definitely missing out. I suggest your own road trip.)<br /><br />The race of the main characters does add some racial jokes, but does not deter the viewer into an ulterior, underlying motive. The Director (Danny Leiner) goes for the laughs first.<br /><br />This unrated DVD is one to put in the view under the influence category. Doogie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) makes a special appearance to tell the world he is still available for work. Buddy Lee and Anthony Anderson also make cameos.</p></br></body></html>
