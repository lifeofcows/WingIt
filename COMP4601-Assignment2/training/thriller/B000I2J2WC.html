The movie's departures from the book raises even more questions than the book did. I still don't understand the Priory of Sion's motives in keeping the Grail secret. Destroy the secrets and you keep the grail safe. Why keep it secret? Why reveal it at the millenia? Why would Sophie be the one descendant to reveal it? Why is there only one descendant left? Shouldn't there be thousands of descendants after all these years? How would the 2000 year old corpse prove anything? So what if Sophie is a descendant of Mary M.? We don't have Christ's DNA. I'm willing to postulate there are descendants of Mary M. running around, but this doesn't prove Sophie is a descendant of Jesus. It means Mary M. had children. I mean, I know it is a work of fiction, but come on. Doesn't a few plot holes need to be filled?<br /><br />Questions aside, the acting was ok I guess. Hanks hair is fine. The scenery was ok. The movie seemed very long to me. The action sequences if you can call them action sequences were pretty bad. The camera turns away during most of the "action" sequences. Think about it. The historical flashbacks were very lame: the world was wonderful before the church came along? We all got along. Really, we did. The puzzle solving was strange. Ron Howard used the same techniques that he used in "A Beautiful Mind." They really don't work here. I mean they don't even give a hint what was going on in Langdon's mind. The apple sequence at the end with the moons and the planets whirling around. Didn't help.<br /><br />I was mostly bored I guess. The book was lame, but it was a page turner. The movie wasn't even that.<br /><br />Ah yes. The special features. I picked the interview with Dan Brown. It  was very lame. For example, they had a section called "Research." He spent a year researching the book and a year writing it. That was all the content. There was no comment on how he conducted the research.  Just how long he spent on it. Fascinating. I didn't have the guts to try the other features. I was still slapping my face trying to wake up from the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>The movie is sufficiently true to the book, but still leaves out a good bit of detail as is always necessary to putting an intellectually challenging book on the big screen. So it is clearly worthwhile to experience both. In this case, the movie should probably come first, so as to give the reader some visual images to help in understanding the book.<br /><br />Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is an expert in symbols, and specifically in historical symbols. His name was on the appointment book of the murdered curator of the Louvre, and the police naturally come looking for him to explain the symbolism associated with the body. In fact, the body was laid out on the floor of the grand gallery in imitation of the Vetruvian Man, one of DaVinci's most famous drawings. While Langdon is able to explain some things to the police, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) shows up. She is a cryptologist for the police department, and so the policemen on the case believe her when she says the department sent her there. She says she comes with an urgent message for Langdon from the American embassy.<br /><br />But as we quickly learn in this movie, nothing and no one is what it seems, people lie and misdirect and do enigmatic things so fast and confusingly that all the audience can say is well, it will make sense later on. And credit to both author Dan Brown and director Ron Howard, they do. No significant loose ends remain at the end of the film except one: the answer to the question "What will Sophie do now?" You have to get there to understand how significant that question is.<br /><br />The heart of the story is some history which can be interpreted in different ways, and some archeology, and more than a little speculation. There has long been a suggestion that the Holy Grail is not a chalice used at the Last Supper, but something more secret. And it is true that no single chalice is in front of Jesus in the DaVinci painting of the last supper. Instead, each place is set with a small and rather ordinary cup. And all the things said about that painting and about the Mona Lisa are true and can be verified by checking any decent reproduction of these extremely famous paintings. The interpretations are not all Dan Brown's, either, but collected from a variety of sources.<br /><br />So if you want to discover exactly how much truth is in the story (which is admittedly fiction), one thing you will need to do is look closely at those two paintings, at least in good copies. Another would be to research the truth of various architectural gems which are referenced in the story, although Brown states at the outset that they are true. Certainly just taking his word for it is not good enough. The church history he expounds would also have to be examined closely for the truth of many assertions.<br /><br />I've not done that, nor have I examined the various conflicting claims as to what is or is not true which have been done by others, at least not in any great detail. But then I don't have a problem with saying that it may or may not be true and leaving it at that. The ability to suspend judgment is a useful art. "Maybe" is a very, very useful word. Keep it in mind as you explore this story.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This movie is a crackling, fast-moving thriller. Something of a pleasant surprise. If you liked the book, you'll like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I admit it.  I'm one of the few. . .the proud. . .the brave. . .who has not read Dan Brown's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400079179">The Da Vinci Code</a>.  I generally eschew pop culture, which this book most certainly is, yet when I caught the film version of THE DA VINCI CODE on cable recently, I immediately was entertained.  I knew bits and pieces of the story--the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, the Apocrypha, a Vatican cover-up--so it didn't take much (a disturbing, very bizarre murder/mutilation) to get me hooked as this fast-paced thriller took off.<br /><br />So because I had not read the book, I had no preconceived notions of main character Robert Langdon; accordingly, Tom Hanks was just fine--although his hair was kind of. . .odd.  Hanks plays very well off the delightful Audrey Tautou, who in turn possesses a most euphonious accent (and is easy on the eye).  Following the murder both Hanks and Tautou embark on a breathless journey through France and England--pursued by the police and a self-flagellating albino monk--in search of an artifact that, if found, could scandalize Christianity to its very ecclesiastical core.  They are joined in the chase by an ornery Ian McKellen playing a colleague of Hanks and a self-proclaimed Holy Grail expert.<br /><br />Through all the twists and turns this film reaches its inevitable over-the-top ending, yet it's all good religious fun.  And through the viewing experience I learned about symbology, cryptology, the Priory, Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper', and a well-traveled sarcophagus--all without reading the book, mind you.  Plus director Ron Howard has yet to make a dog; his THE DA VINCI CODE is certainly no exception to this noteworthy trend.<br />--D.

Even though this movie did have some variations from the book, I felt it was still very well done and kept me interested to the end, just as the book did.  This is one of those keeper movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>The book is much better than the film, but looking at the numbers of people that went to see it, nobody seemed to care. As the intelligent plot needed to be squeezed into a normal length movie, the story is constantly in a rush. Perhaps some kind of series would have been a better idea..Anyway all other details, like actors and pictures looks well in order. It's almost impossible to accept Tom Hanks as a professor though. Couldn't they find someone else for that part? With the exception of Saving Private Ryan and Road to perdition that guy has been playing nitwits all his life. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>The film started well enough, I suppose, though for all the money the book made I kinda expected something a little better-set-up than a priest who gets shot (from near point-blank range) in the stomach so that he has just enough time to leave some incredibly cryptic clues for his pal Robert Langdon.  Nonetheless it captured my interest for a while despite the complete lack of plausibility, and I liked some of the details (e.g. the bullet stopping the door from shutting).<br /><br />But fairly soon after Ian McKellan shows up things start bogging down.  McKellan's character is lively, but the backstory is heavy even without appearances by Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany's respective characters.  Numerous twists and turns keep occurring and the pace of the film began to crawl.  By the time of the denouement (which I found amusing, and not in a good way) I was checking my watch every 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />So the verdict?  A disappointing 2 stars out of 4.  The movie's theology is sometimes interesting but far too trivial to carry the film (let alone provide controversy, in my mind, but that ship has sailed) so the movie has to fall back upon its "thriller" aspects, and that aspect isn't strong enough to carry the film either.  Don't bother deciphering this code :)</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Everybody participating in this film probably never stood a chance. Incredibly gifted actors like Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen were compelled to utter the most banal lines perhaps in their entire careers. I suspected the ending almost half way through the picture.  I have not read Dan Brown's book. The fact that the novel revolves around the possibility of a generation-to-generation conspiracy is inherently preposterous.  Real people rarely keep secrets. A large number never do. The very premise of The Da Vinci Code contradicts everything we know about human psychology. Homo sapiens do not remain loyal to a religious institution they know is premised upon lies. Moreover, they are especially unlikely to murder on its behalf.  I may be an ex-Catholic, but I refuse to indulge in blind hatred towards my former religious home. The Church of Rome deserves better than this slanderous attack.<br /><br />An earlier reviewer perspicaciously pointed out that "The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip." I can't do any better. This is a three and a half star film. Do you enjoy pure escapism? If so, you might find The Da Vinci Code worthy of a few hours of your limited life span. I personally refuse to see it a second time. Once is more than enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>I was pleasently surprised by this movie! I never read the book but after seeing the movie I am considering it. Normally I am not into religious movies but this was not bad. If you are expecting a fast paced, action packed Indiana Jones treasure hunt kind of movie this probably is not the film for you but if you are looking for a suspenseful, dramatic and intellectual movie, give this one a try. It's visually beautiful and has great music. I liked the acting, liked the characters and loved the way it was filmed. I actually heard about the theories the book is based on years ago. As far as the religious meaning behind the movie or the debate of it's fact and fiction, I choose to remain neutral on the topic. I find it in poor taste when people preach about their religious beliefs in a review so I won't do that to anyone reading this. I choose instead to judge this movie on it's artistic value. It was an awesome work of art, had some great twists and turns, kept my attention and I would watch it again though I doubt I would buy it for my collection. This will never be an all-time favorite movie for me but it made me want to read the book and it was certainly worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code, written by Dan Brown, was one of those books that became a blockbuster but partly for the wrong reasons. While it was indeed a good read, the main selling point was its tackling of religious issues, especially dealing with the legend of the Holy Grail and what it actually is. Naturally a film version was in order and who do we get to adapt this mega-hit? None other than Ron Howard, director of Backdraft, Apollo 13 and a Beautiful Mind, with the film being adapted by Akiva Goldsman(ugh). Is it as bad as the critics said it was? Not quite but it's definately a massively missed opportunity.<br /><br />Robert Langdon, a symbologist and professor is called into to oversee a body murdered in the Louvre: a naked old man who mutilated a pentagram onto himself and left some clues. Of course, the police believe he's guilty of it so he has to team up with crytologist Sophie Neveu to solve the riddle of one of the most well-guarded secrets(well, in fantasy land anyway) in history. Chasing them is Silas, an albino monk prone to self-flagellation, a corrupt Bishop and an elusive character known as the Teacher.<br /><br />Having conversations with a friend of mine is always a minefield because she hates swearing and sometimes I tend to become a sailor. In many ways that's exactly how people reacted to this film: overdoing it. It's a book, it's not an expose piece a la CNN debunking an entire religion, it's fiction, same way an author might talk of an apocalyptic world despite the fact we still have airplanes and malls and ice cream parlors. That's your basic mindset upon first reading the book: don't believe everything. With the movie? Same thing but don't think you're going to watch a great movie. In fact that's where the film drops the ball: what should've been a great entertaining film is merely a serviceable adaptation but missing key things. For one: the film's just not exciting. I literally finished the book in one night cause it was so engrossing. Here, it's like once is enough. Second: the film feels rushed as if you can easily digest all the massive amounts of exposition on the go. That's why the book worked: I can re-read all the sections about Christian history: here's it's just whoosh!<br /><br />How's the casting? Ironically, I couldn't think of anyone else(besides Hugh Jackman maybe) to play Robert Langdon than Tom Hanks but he almost sleepwalks at times though it's probably not his fault. Knowing he had a blockbuster on his hands, Howard probably just rushed through his takes. And what better actress(and adorable one too) to play Sophie than Audrey Tautou of Amelie fame? Then of course there's scene-stealer Ian McKellan and creepy Paul Bettany as Leigh Teabing and Silas respectively. But as I said, some of it seems very first-take stuff. What helps the film is the added visuals to help with the clue solving. Letters appear brightened, flashbacks are used and in my favorite segment, a computer teaching tool is used for the Last Supper. It makes the film very similar to National Treasure and regardless of your feelings on the plot, this kind of stuff is always fascinating.<br /><br />How's the special features? It felt very studio-sanctioned stuff. This, along with the Matrix, can play host to numerous commentaries from Director and Cast and Crew to Dan Brown himself to even scholars to debunk Brown's conclusions or even support theories. No such thing. The stuff that is in here feels very surface-skimming as if the studio said "okay, 5 minutes is enough on this segment, next!" Whatever happened to documentaries like Episode I's the Beginning or the Appendices from Lord of the Rings?<br /><br />If you're a big fan of the book, of course I'd recommend it since it makes the stuff from the book cooler but if you're ultra-Catholic than stay away. Those looking for thrillers be warned while those looking for good escapism of pretty much found it with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>Calling to mind that the novel "rhe Da Vinci Code" by the controversial Dan Btown primarily reads as a series of cerebral puzzles packaged as a suspense thriller pitting an ultra conservative branch of the Roman Catholic Church (Opus Dei) against a secret society protecting a 2000 year old secret surely explains why some critics claim that Ron Howard's 2006 film of the same name seems "weighed down in exposition and talkiness." (USA Today, May 19, 2006)<br /><br />Instead of remembering that the novel waxes "pedestrian" with Eureka moments by utilizing some fairly simplistic brainteasers which lead main characters Robert Langdon, an imminent Harvard symbolist,and Sophie Neveu, DCPJ cryptologist, down a labyrinthine rabbit hole where one amazing conclusion emerges, threatening to tumble the very pillars of Christian dogma decided upon in the year 325 at the council of Nicaea, reviewers penalize the movie for simply following the book's formula without the benefit of the shortened suspense apposite chapters.  Howard chooses for brevity's sake to forego many of the book's conundrums---the mystery of backwards DaVincian script which absorbs two or three pages is wisely condensed into one knowing statement of fact.  In a style typified in "A Beautiful Mind" to encapsulate the inner workings of genius schizophrenic John Nash, Howard binds Hans Zimmer music to CSI-demonstrative visual effects to cleverly illustrate each twist of the ultimate conspiracy for those of us not adept at piecing together clues involving art, religion, history, secret societies and arcane rituals.<br /><br />As with most films, Howard's "Da Vinci Code" performs to a mainstream audience and should succeed in entertaining accordingly.  A Tom Hanks with a poorly cut wannabe-professor's do plays the part of "Harrison Ford in Harris Tweed" with a likeable gravitas that includes ample sympathy and dawning understanding for his accidental sidekick, Amelie-waif Audrey Tautou whose chocolate brown eyes convey all the pathos expected from a by-product of the Greatest Story Ever Told.  Supporting cast members like Ian McKellan---admirably flipping from fanatical scholar to duplicitous tactician----Jean Reno----adding a manly French flavor packet to the book's otherwise stereotypical dogged flatfoot Bezu Fache-----and Paul Bettany-----almost unrecognizable as the overtly intense self-flagellating monk Silas after dryly sarcastic roles in "Wimbledon" and "A Beautiful Mind"-----capture the usual suspense genre second string to quirky perfection.<br /><br />All in all, the movie adequately represents Dan Brown's brainchild, offering to audiences two and a half hours of non-stop entertainment.  Bottom  line?  If the book titillated, so will the movie, in spite of the fact of an already revealed mystery and a reader's digest version of the sub-puzzles.  Visually agreeable, like most high budget films, the book and its characters come to as much of a celluloid life as is rendered possible given the original nature of the novel.  Are the prequel events of Langdon in "Angels and Demons" already in the works?<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Famous books are always screaming for a film version. Indeed, "Gone With the Wind" was bought and put into production almost immediately after its publication in 1937. That was a tough book to film, and came out fine. Dan Brown's "The DaVinci Code" must've also been tough to film, if only for the protests that surrounded it. I applaud anyone who comes up with a new idea regarding anything. Certainly, filmmakers have been fascinated with such conundrums as the origin of the universe, life on other planets, the end of the world, re-structuring other cultures, etc. That Ron Howard had the courage to tackle this controversial book, with an equally courageous screenplay treatment by Akiva Goldsman, is NOT to be dismissed. It is merely an interpretation of an alternative idea, including the hate-mongers who will suppress those ideas. I give Mr. Howard & Mr. Goldsman credit for this creative effort. The plot has a few holes, and certainly will offend "by-the-book" Christians, but, as filmmaking, it succeeds quite well. The film itself is very talky, requires concentration, and has a lot of slow moments that will annoy the average American filmgoer. At 149 minutes, it tells a tale that is far-fetched at first then grabs our attention, mostly because of the excellent acting from all involved. Indeed, Ian McKellan may finally receive a long overdue Oscar, if the Academy can remember that far back. Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow...this is A-List casting, and none disappointed. I was also impressed with the editing, which kept the film taut and interesting at all times, allowing the slow moments to prepare the viewer for the excitement that follows. The DVD 2nd disc is rife with interesting stuff.  You don't have to believe the premise. All you have to do is kick back and absorb a fine, exciting narrative that will not fail to entertain.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I'm probably one of the few people in America who haven't read Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code." The novel was a bestseller for, at least, a couple of years and I knew when I saw the book riding high on the bestseller list that a movie was inevitable. I gave up on going to read the book when I heard about the movie. After all, the movie had to be good. It starred two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and French actress Audrey Tatou ('Amelie'), was directed by Oscar winner Ron Howard, and written by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman. The movie came out and something strange happened. It got lukewarm reviews from critics and, judging by the reviews on Amazon, people don't like the movie much either. Keeping in mind that I've never read the book, I don't know how it holds up to the movie...But I got to say. I liked this movie, it's not perfect. But it's pretty good. The movie stars Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon, an expert on symbols. While doing what appears to be a book signing in France, he's brought into a gallery to identify symbols that have been carved into a murdered man's body. The man is Jacques Sauniere, a man Langdon was scheduled to have a drink with that very day. The murder scene is a bit strange, since Sauniere was shot and carved the symbols into his body himself. While Langdon is questioned by Captain Fache (Jean Reno), a young woman named Sophie Neveu (Tatou) arrives and warns Langdon that he's the suspect in the murder of Sauniere. The man who happens to be her grandfather. As they scramble for clues, they find a message from Sauniere that fuels the rest of the movie. A lot of the stuff that occurs later in this movie would be considered a "twist" in most films, but due to all the controversy surrounding it's subject, everyone knows what's happening. As you know, Langdon and Sophie are looking for the Holy Grail which is not, as rumored, a cup...It's a person. The spawn of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Standing in their way is a murderous albino rabbi named Silas (an evil-looking Paul Bettany, in one of his best performances) and an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina, 'Spider-Man 2'). Also helping Langdon and Sophie in their search is Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen, who's great here), a cripple who's an expert on all things religious. This movie has caused controversy for everything. The fact that it contradicts religion, the fact that an albino is the villain, the fact that Opus Dei is portrayed incorrectly. What people don't realize is that Dan Brown was not writing a history novel and Ron Howard is not making a non-fiction film. This movie is meant to be pure fiction, existing solely for the purpose of entertaining the masses. As for entertainment value, The Da Vinci Code has its highs and lows. It can be very entertaining one moment and seem never-ending the next. I was impressed by how much research went into the writing of this stuff. Even though it's fiction, it seems thoroughly researched. The performances are strong, the action scenes are well filmed, and the movie has great cinematography and art direction. I don't think we'll see it mentioned come Oscar time, but it's a nice thought-provoking way to pass the time.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Had I not read the book I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more (probably no surprise here). I kept trying to anticipate what they would do next and ended up disappointed when things were left out. This does not make it a bad movie. I'm confirming it is difficult to enjoy after reading the book.<br /><br />The movie attempts to be as faithful as it can in the three hours allotted. I didn't mind most of the character choices. I had read some complaints about Tom Hanks in the role but I found him believable and acceptable. Ian McKellan is always an excellent villain and his portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing is no different. Audrey Tautou is quite the shapeshifter in her roles. As Sophie she is soft with an underlying strength required for her character. But I didn't feel the chemistry the book has between her and Langton. Paul Bettany (forever my Chaucer) who plays the albino Silas was a bit of a disappointment to me. Even his whitening makeup was obvious in some scenes and the trademark eyes were missing.<br /><br />A very important scene at the end where Sophie reunites with her brother was not included. I think this was a pivotal reunion for Sophie's character. Her reunion with her grandmother was also anticlimactic. Sophie played a very small role in the discovery of the grail other than providing a personal history. I remember her being a stronger character academically and more involved in the code cracking in the book.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good movie. Mystery, action, history, intrigue and the continual battle of good against evil.

The basic idea is quite appealing: an alternative reading of Christian history, a conspiracy theory based on male chauvinism and competition among the initial followers, a 'what if' follow up with Jesus as a family man. All this is ok and can be turned into an interesting story. Brown has shown us that he could turn it into a hugely successfull story without bothering to write a good novel. His version of the mis-named 'Da Vinci Code' is primitive pulp fiction.<br /><br />Now the movie comes along with some great names in the cast, with a script following the novel as closely as feasible, and ends up with a film that I personally found unbearably bad and incompetent. Everything is overdosed: the conspiracies first of all. The suspense mechanism of the novel was hard enough to tolerate; in the movie it reaches the IQ level of children's pulp cartoons. The two main actors add their share to the feeling of amateurism. I had thought, in the last century, that Hanks is essentially a competent actor. Not here. Let's not talk about the lead actress, she is a total failure. Same goes for other key characters, like the ridiculous Albino played by the former Maturin impersonator, or the laughable French cop played by Reno, or the joke of an Opus Dei leader played by Molina.<br /><br />As we have learned from pharmacology and from cooking classes: the dosis determines if a substance is poisonous, respectively the food edible, or not.<br /><br />This movie overdoses on almost everything and is entirely unpalatable.

But the real unforgivable sin here is that the movie is boring.<br /><br />Even Tom Hanks said it's just a movie about a bunch of "religious hooey."  But the sin of the filmmakers is that by trying to stick to the letter of the book and not the mood, wrecked the story and it got off track on its way to becoming a movie -- and the film derailed.<br /><br />That said, the movie version of Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" works best for those who buy into the hoopla and publicity and still think the book is factual and not clever fiction.

That said, overall it really isn't a bad movie.  Ron Howard, who is kind of a poor man's Spielberg, had the good sense to populate his movie with A-list actors.  This is a good thing, because every ten minutes or so there is some explanation for a mystery or puzzle, that is usually best left on the page rather than in a movie.  And Da Vinci Code has those in dizzying numbers.  The result is that Hanks (bad hair!) as super symbol-guy Robert Langdon, and Audrey Tautou (good hair!) as cryptologist Sophie Nevue are pretty much reduced to (as they catch their breath) constantly delivering where-are-we-now speeches in their hunt for the "truth."  As much as this cuts against both of these actors real strengths as actors, it oddly doesn't sink the film.  The X factor is Ian McKellan as Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing, McKellan who clearly has puckish fun with the role.  And it is about at this point in the movie that the cumulative effect of all this alternative history regarding Jesus and Mary Magdalene, their protectors and attackers, begins to take hold.<br /><br />What can I say?  That sure looks like a woman in that painting by Da Vinci.  I know I've looked at the painting umpteen times, but it's true that the body language, posture, face, sure look feminine, and seems in sharp contrast with the male figures in the painting.  I don't know about all that other mumbo-jumbo regarding "V" in the painting - the female principle and God, but as a movie it works in a fun way, getting you thinking.  The chase aspect of this story however is clunky, and if anything makes the movie seem longer than it should be.  Character motivations are tissue-thin, and characters in general are cardboard ones, propped up a bit, as I said earlier, by very good actors.  However, the payoff at the end of the film is worth it.  And I have to admit, I was moved.  If nothing else was accomplished by this movie, the clearing of Mary Magdalene's name has at least been partly accomplished - at least more so than any vague Vatican statement regarding her not being a prostitute.  Howard has delivered up some real bloated junk food over the years, but Da Vinci Code, a difficult project for any director, is one of best his efforts.  3 and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I don't understand the controversy over this book/movie. I've seen entire TV specials on church channels where religious leaders and scholars work so hard to disprove this FICTIONAL story. I mean, it seems a bit ridiculous to me and makes me think that the church really does have something to hide. But conspiracies aside, I thought this was a very smart movie and I love adventures and clue solving. I'm giving it four stars because of the terrible DVD translation. Often times the characters wouldn't be speaking English so subtitles were needed but they put the subtitles so far down that, if you have a wide screen television like I do, they aren't visible unless you format your TV to where the picture is all squished. I wasn't at all pleased with that. But great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>I really enjoy Ron Howard's "The Da Vinci Code". Its intresting, thought provoking, and thrilling. Decent performences, great direction and a well thoughtout story make this a good film in my opinion. I am glad to own the DVD and the Special Edition does the film justice. If you are intrested in religious themed films (though the events and history in the film are fake) or into conspiracy films, you will enjoy this.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Not having read Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code", I had few expectations for this film, ignoring much of the controversy surrounding both the novel and the film. I'm surprised that "The Da Vinci Code" has garnered many poor reviews, since it may be the best film - and without a doubt, the best thriller - made by director Ron Howard. Distinguished screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has also written a superb script which apparently adheres closely to the original novel's tale, but with a more exciting, and better, ending. I was most impressed with the film's pacing, with splendid acting from the cast, including Tom Hanks as Harvard professor Robert Langdon. Noted young French actress Audrey Tautou gives a splendid performance as French cryptologist Sophie Neveu. Other memorable performances include those by veteran French actor Jean Reno as Paris Police Captain Fache, popular young English actor Paul Bettany as Silas, the murderous albino monk, and acclaimed German actor Jurgen Prochnow as the slippery Swiss banker Andr&eacute; Vernet. I was also delighted to see Alfred Molina play yet another fascinating villain as Bishop Aringarosa. But some of the most thrilling scenes are those that include acclaimed British actor Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, who plays a most important role in the unfolding quest led by Langdon and Neveu in search of The Holy Grail. I found "The Da Vinci Code" as exciting as some of the best in the "James Bond" series featuring actor Sean Connery as James Bond; the film itself had nonstop excitement and intrigue, with rarely a dull moment, inspite of its long running time.<br /><br />Many critics of the film have suggested that it tends to be too talkative, allegedly slowing down the film's pace. I strongly disagree, since I found "The Da Vinci Code" a fascinating, intelligent, and rather exciting thriller, which kept me at the edge of my seat when I saw the film earlier today. Other critics have been those who have objected to the film's portrayal of the fundamentalist Roman Catholic sect Opus Dei, but this thoughtful criticism should be aimed instead at author Dan Brown, the novel's writer (It's a criticism that I am somewhat in agreement with, since I found almost incredible, the character of Silas, the murderous monk, even if he was portrayed brilliantly by actor Paul Bettany.). Despite these criticisms, I still think that diehard fans of Dan Brown's novel - and those like myself who haven't read it - will enjoy "The Da Vinci Code" as a gripping cinematic thriller. Without a doubt, Ron Howard's newest film should be regarded as one of the best films to see in theaters during the summer of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code is making it's debut on Blu Ray and I'm loving it,it has the extended cut of the film,making a long film even longer,the theatrical was 149 min.,this extended cut is 174 min.,so you'll need a nice block of time to see this one,being that the new extended cut is almost 3 hours long,that's not counting the nice supplimantal section(this is a 2 disc set mind you!)There more added to the storyline,now i'm ready to see Angels & Demons!!! My only quibble is they could have put BOTH Theatrical and Extended versions on the same Blu Ray disc,that's my only gripe,and a small one at that!!! This is one example that the extended version is actually better that the theatrical(just wish that LOTR was getting the extended treatment for it's debut on Blu!) Recommended!!!

Of course, historic accuracy was not an intent of the movie nor the book on which it was based.  But such statements as implying that the Gnostic sects portrayed Jesus Christ as more man than diety is the polar opposite of what those sects taught.  Gnostics, like many sects, saw the physical world as inherently evil and therefore tended to argue that Jesus could not have been a physical man at all - or that his physical nature was subdued by his spiritual nature in some way.  Quite contrary to the theory of the Da Vinci Code protagonists.  That one inaccuracy alone should be sufficient to demonstrate the questionable theories some have claimed for the movie and the book.  It cannot be taken seriously as an historical treatise of any kind but it can be accepted as entertaining action adventure.  Those who aspire to or hate the theories of the protagonists perhaps take movies too seriously.  Sufficient is the statement that much false history is espoused by many with their own agenda as their sole guide to truth - as with everything else, do your own thinking and do not take movies or popular fiction too seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>This was a brilliant movie!!!! I mean, they had a great cast and Tom Hanks did a stand up job with his roll as Robert Langdon. The plot starts out very simple with a murder of one, of Langdon's friends at the Lourve in Paris. But when Langdon is notified about it. Then Langdon and a female cryptologist discover a very deep complex mystery behind the murder, that they must solve. Which will lead them to discover a secret link to the time of Christ. This is a great movie. But, you gotta make sure that you pay attention, while you are watching it. Or else, you will not understand it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code is the type of movie that grabs your attention from the start and never stops. We read the book first, then acquired a previous work by the same author, Angels & Demons, which is also a masterpiece. The controversy created by these books provide an ever-ending topic of conversation. While reading the book, I could not believe that I had missed seeing the "clues" mentioned by the author on the works of Da Vinci, especially with regards to his famous "The Last Supper." So we went to the library, obtained an arts book and with a magnifying glass, observed that all details as mentioned by the book were there, and yet, they had gone unnoticed when we had studied the work. If you allow yourself to research as you go along reading, The Da Vinci Code is simply... fascinating. When the movie came out, a group of friends went to see it at the theatre, and we then had dinner to discuss the performance. We agree that the movie is fabulous. The plot is followed to provide entertainment without measure, but, we agreed that for those who had not read the book, the movie could be rather confusing. The script follows Dan Brown's book to the point, incorporating changes that were surprising and welcomed, for the ending is easier to understand. The performance by Tom Hanks, who plays the Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon is excellent. The images played on the screen behind him immediately allows us to realize the power of symbols and how deceptive they may be if we do not know the origin and meaning intended when they were created. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu and does an outstanding job, very believable. The movie is filmed on location and it is simply superb to be able to see the book we loved to read... come to life! Neveu and Langdon join forces to solve many mysteries and they capture our attention and imagination from the start. Sir Ian McKellen provides an excellent performance as Sir Leigh Teabing, making this movie an unforgettable experience. To enjoy the movie to its fullest, we highly recommend reading The Da Vinci Code... as well as Angels & Demons... and then... sitting to enjoy a movie... and a story line... that has traveled world-wide.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code is a movie that has been the object of critics' scorn since Cannes.  Therefore when I went in my expectations were quite low.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed this intellectual treasure hunt.  Action sequences boldly intertwine with quieter scenes where codes and symbols are being deciphered to lead to the next clue.  At times we get the back story of what has happened to a persecuted religious sect through out the ages.  The flashbacks to ancient Rome are brief but beautiful.  In addition there are some gorgeous locations for filming, among them the Louvre and Rosslyn.<br /><br />Hanks and Tautou perform like the pros that they are--it is interesting that two actors known for their whimsical charms were cast in such serious roles. Generally  actors starring in thrillers will be those known for their laconic delivery and quietly passionate intensity.  However, Tom Hanks was playing a professor of symbology and as such he did a fine job.<br /><br />The supporting cast reads like a list of international superstars:  Alfred Molina, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Jurgen Prochnow--all were superb.<br /><br />One of things I liked about this film is how it gave the audience the opportunity to view the world from the perspective of someone who is used to looking at symbols and their meanings, in particular of things that most of us don't even notice most of the time. It was an unusual and fascinating angle on perception.<br /><br />This a movie that tries to pack some very deep concepts into the thriller/treasure hunt genre.  Overall I think it succeeds rather well.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>The radical and controversial reaction caused by the movie The Da Vinci Code was to be expected since the moment director Ron Howard decided to make it, for in the last couple of years few books have generated such an extreme polemic reaction that, four years after its publication, seems like it will never end.<br /><br />My review will be limited to comment the movie, because it is not my intention to start a religious debate about the theories exposed in the novel. For me, The Da Vinci Code is just another fiction film, and as such, I will discuss it.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, etc., that combines adventure, history, mythologym mystery and action. The plot revolves around Harvard History/Symbology Professor Robert Langdon, French Cryptologist Sophie Neveau and their quest to discover the hidden clues left by the Louvre's Museum Curator before he was murdered by an Opus Dei Monk called Silas. These clues are part of a secret that -if revealed- would supposedly change the course of history: the truth about the Holy Grail. Of course, there will be allies for Langdon and Neveau in this journey, like an eccentric Englishman (the always fabulous Ian McKellen) and some detractors, an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina), members of the Catholic Church, a French policeman (Jean Reno) and a secret "master" that desperately wants to uncover the truth.<br /><br />It's a long journey through history, religions, family secrets and complex puzzles and riddles. Screenwiter Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) does a great job compressing the detailed narrative from Brown's book, allowing himself to take some liberties with the plot, which results in unexpected twists, but welcome ones.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are as plain as they are on the book, but each actor does the best they can with their parts. The exceptions are Sir Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany, whose characters are the richest and in consequence, the more interesting ones.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a good thriller-adventure movie, filmed in gorgeous settings, starring a very attractive cast and enhanced with a score by Hans Zimmer. His contribution is most notorious and grateful in the last ten minutes, where Howard offers a respectful and almost reverential finale to Langdon's journey, and with that, a spectacular ending to a very entertaining movie. Yes, a movie, just a movie, nothing else.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>It's readily agreed that director Ron Howard's uneven adaptation of the Dan Brown best-seller will not win any major awards. When considering the expository nature of the source material, it's amazing that "The Da Vinci Code" came off as well as it did. Though overlong and rather talky in spots, Howard has crafted a diverting mystery-thriller that benefits immeasurably from Sir Ian McKellan's bravura performance. Audrey Tautou is the ideal Sophie, but Tom Hanks cannot overcome his miscasting as Professor Robert Langdon. Still, it's a brave attempt.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Movies based on best-selling books are a risk in Hollywood as fans of the book often have high expectations and can grill a movie if it does not satisfy them.  The makers of the Harry Potter and LOTR movies generally pleased the book fans, whereas the makers of Troy, Dinotopia, and War of the Worlds have not pleased the book fans.  This being said, making a movie on a controversial book is an even greater risk, and The Da Vinci Code is probably one of the more controversial books to appear in the English language in the past 10 years.  But the makers of the movie did their homework alright.  First, they gathered a good cast of actors and actresses, including two of the best in Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen.  Second, they made sure to use actors that reflected the nationalities of the characters in the book.  Third, they picked a great composer to make an original soundtrack.  And last, Ron Howard was a great choice as a director.  The result is one of the best movies of 2006.<br /><br />I have never read the book, but I can say that this movie is very engaging and interesting.  The story starts with the killing of an important person who knows a very important secret.  The rest of the movie proceeds as a series of secrets being unraveled, with the audience finding out as the protagonists find out.  The movie ends with the female lead discovering her true identity, and the male lead finding the final resting place of Mary Magdalene.  In between are many well-done episodes of suspense, action, comedy, and drama.  The dialogue is quite good and shows each character to have a depth of experience and a complex range of drives and emotions.  The special effects are also quite good, and at numerous times, flashbacks are made to important acts in history.  These look quite impressive.<br /><br />This DVD set comes with multiple special features including interviews with all the principal actors and actresses.  There are also features on the soundtrack, the book, and of course, interviews with the book's author.  All in all, this was one of the best movies of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Da vinci code couldn't quite live up to the publicity i guess.. not that it deserved any of it to begin with (goes to show how narrow-minded people are when they are so shocked by the slightest hint of change)..<br /><br />Yes it is an interesting thought that the church is sitting on top of some grandiose conspiracy - it probably is as a matter of fact (though i doubt it involves mary magdalene).. What we have here is something that is intriguing but it doesn't take us to that extra step - it isn't spellbinding (no where near in fact)..

All of the religious issues aside (I'm Catholic and not convinced by this work of FICTION!), "Code" read like a big action/mystery yarn with a non-stop chase sequence.  Unfortunately, Ron Howard's handling of the book on the big screen isn't what I'd hoped for.  The story seems to get lost in the "whodunit?" aspect and leaves most viewers (like my wife) completely lost until the end of the film.  Also, the characters aren't developed well enough to have any attachment to them.  In the book, Silas comes across as one of the most pitiful creatures on the planet.  Manipulated by those who use his convictions against him, Silas is one of the most saddening characters I've ever run into.  On the big screen, he's portrayed as nothing but a religious zealot until the bloody end.  Tom Hanks, Jean Reno, and Alfred Molina all play their respective characters well, but I can find no attachment to them.  Audrey Tautou is, in my opinion, very unlikeable as Sophie.  The biggest shocker to me was Ian McKellen's total misplay of Teabing.  In the book, Teabing was drawn out as the jolly scoundrel who got away with any and everything because he's British.  In this movie, McKellen plays down the character and even though he still has that British charm about him, he's not as interesting as I'd hoped he be.<br /><br />In short, read the book, kiddoes.  It's much better than this film.  As far as the DVD goes, it's packed with the typical "pat on the back" documenaries.  The digital transfer is nice, and I have no complaints about the audio.  I just feel that the film is nowhere near as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Don't let the religious twists and historical inaccuracies discourage you, this is a very good story, but it's so much better on the page than it is on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>In terms of the mechanics of film making this was an OK movie.........

I agree with the critics who think the actors are rather aloof.  This had Harrison Ford written all over it.  BUT... the story propels the movie forward.<br /><br />I had read the book twice, and I went to see the movie with friends, three who had read the book, and two who did not.  All liked the movie, but the two who did not read the book thought it was a bit confusing.  Two of us, one who had read the book and one who didn't, thought the beginning quite boring, and almost fell asleep!  Alas, that included me.<br /><br />Critics and supporters of The Da Vinci Code seem to be fixated on what is real and what is fiction.  Who cares?  For those who depend on Dan Brown for historical analysis, you should expand your reading.  For those who want to support, or discredit, Opus Dei and the Catholic Church, you probably don't need this movie (or the book) to hold up your thesis.<br /><br />Whatever your politics, look at the movie as entertainment.  If you do, you will find The Da Vinci Code better than expected.  But I wish the first thirty minutes had a little more "pep"...</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Was there ever a doubt in anyone's mind that "The Da Vinci Code" would wind up on the big screen? Dan Brown's novel of religious mystery and intrigue has remained such a literary phenomenon that a film adaptation had to have been ready right from the word go. Ron Howard should thank his lucky stars that he was offered the role of director; anyone who understands just how big a story this is would have killed for the opportunity he was given. The ones who turned the project down will probably forever kick themselves in sheer frustration, proof that you should never pass up a golden opportunity. I suppose there is a down side; in taking the job, Howard made himself vulnerable to the outrage of the religious community, specifically the Catholic Church. They've certainly been vocal in their hatred of this story, both as a novel and as a film.<br /><br />But at the same time, there are multitudes that support the efforts made by Brown and Howard. And now, they have this film to show for it. Obviously, it's not a perfect adaptation of the novel: several details regarding location, time, and discoveries were either condensed or altogether removed, most likely for the sake of keeping the film going at a reasonable pace. Fortunately, they're all minor changes, ones that don't in any way harm the intention or integrity of the story. Besides, we all know that film is a medium that requires story omissions and alterations when using a written piece as source material. It just comes with the territory. The trick is to remove or alter the right details, the ones that aren't crucial to the plot. The film succeeds in removing all that was unnecessary (someone must have kept a close eye on this during production).<br /><br />The plot: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard Symbology professor visiting Paris to give a lecture on pagan symbolism. During a book signing, he's called upon by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) to aid investigation of a murder in the Louvre museum. The body of Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the museum's curator, lies in a particularly strange position, almost as if it were posing like a figure in one of Leonardo Da Vinci's sketches. But even stranger is the fact that Sauniere positioned himself that way before he died, as if he were trying to give a message to someone....<br /><br />Langdon's expertise on symbolism and the use of a museum-quality ultraviolet light reveal some pretty startling details, ones that set into motion a cross-country scavenger hunt. It also sets into motion a series of murders, accusations, and lies that point directly to Langdon, making him the most wanted man in all of France. But he's not alone; at his side is Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a cunning cryptographer and granddaughter to the murdered Sauniere. Even though she hasn't spoken to her grandfather in ten years (due to her witnessing him engaging in an especially uncommon ritual), she knows that he was trying to tell her something, even in death. She also knows that he trusted Langdon for some reason (even though the two never met), and because of that, she's willing to help Langdon escape. But things get complicated when it's learned that Sauinere was part of a secret society, one whose history revolves around one of the most famous religious icons ever: the Holy Grail.<br /><br />They travel from one location to the other as they follow Sauniere's clues, obscure pieces of information crafted through cryptology. One clue leads them to a Swiss bank where they retrieve a very important object from its vaults, a kind of treasure box created by Sauinere from the sketches of Da Vinci himself. It's made up of a row of discs, each acting as a lock and containing letters of the alphabet. The only way it can be opened is by rotating the discs and spelling out a specific password. Any attempt to break open the device will result in the destruction of its inner contents, thanks to a simple but effective method of security. If Langdon and Sophie wish to safely open this keystone, they need the help of someone who's dedicated his life to the study of the Holy Grail. Here enters Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), a wealthy, colorful British man whose knowledge of the Grail is beyond plentiful.<br /><br />But there's another side to this story, one that involves an ultra-conservative sect of Catholicism called the Opus Dei. The most prominent character associated with this group is Silas (Paul Bettany), an albino monk who takes his faith a little too seriously, believing he needs to be in constant pain in order to remind himself of Christ's suffering (he regularly whips his back with a cat o'nine tails and continuously wears a belt of sharp metal around his thigh). He's been given a mission from a mysterious, hidden figure called The Teacher: get the keystone away from Langdon and Sophie. It contains a powerful secret that they don't want revealed, something that could easily shake the very foundation of the Church as the world knows it. If they have to kill those who stand in the way of their goal, then so be it. Called in to help with this task is Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina), a man whose belief in the traditions of the Catholic Church has made him greedy.<br /><br />It's this very portrayal of the Church that has a lot of people up in arms. To a degree, I understand the resistance; faith is a sacred, personal thing, and any negative representation will be met with hostility. But the naysayers need to realize that "The Da Vinci Code" is nothing more than a non-threatening work of fiction, having very little basis in reality (other than some names and dates). I wish they would understand that; only then will they finally see it in an entirely different light. Both the novel and the movie were so meticulously crafted, so finely and carefully structured, that it doesn't allow itself to be overlooked. That's because this is a puzzle story, basic yet incredibly clever in the way it presents an incomplete picture whose pieces fall into place as it progresses. That's probably one of the reasons why the story is so popular, and it'll most likely be the reason why this movie succeeds: everyone loves a good mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>so dont follow to buy this edition. because i buy more like about the cyptex.

It was OK; an ordinary thriller-mystery.<br />This book was no different, although a more ambitious work: an OK thriller, with a good deal more tedious filler between the action scenes. Oh, yes, I understand that it was the filler (and the usual self-fulfilling process, being hugely successful creates a momentum of public sentiment, which makes something even more hugely successful) that drew in the customers. Given the densely packed  gobble-de-gook of the book, it is a wonder that the writers were able to find anything much to film. Nevertheless, of course, it was filmed. Don't know how it did at the box office; however, the film was the same mediocre story-telling as was the book. Spurts of action, a very mild, almost non-existent romance, and, what often seemed to be endless, senseless chatter. Hammett, did it worlds better, in his novel, The Maltese Falcon, as did the the makers of the Cortez and Bogart filming. It took them only a few minutes to give us all we wanted to know about the history of the Black Bird, and they never let it get in the way of the story.<br />I have only sympathy for Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and the other key figures in the making of the film.

In many ways Ron Howard is the perfect director for it - he still can't create a decent suspense sequence in a thriller but, unashamedly populist and one of the directors least likely to overestimate his audience's intelligence, he keeps things fairly clear and surprisingly inoffensive: it's more likely to be the atheists looking for a flag to rally around who'll feel betrayed than the religious, with the film going to pains to emphasise that being mortal need not invalidate Jesus' message or the value of faith. Indeed, the villain turns out not to be a church figure but the kind of obsessive conspiracy nut who probably makes up the novel's target audience, albeit one ingeniously using the Church as his own personal hitman.<br /><br />The film does a surprisingly imaginative job of illustrating the film's extensive exposition with everything from PowerPoint and computer graphics presentations to some visually striking flashbacks that are also well invoked to imply memories, phobias and personal backstories, while the script has fun setting up various characters as the villain-in-chief only to pull the rug from under you. Even the constant puzzles that drive the story like some sudoko thriller are generally presented in a pleasingly cinematic manner. The film's big conspiracy - hardly a secret people will kill to cover up since it's been the subject of books for decades - doesn't hold water for a second, relying on finding connections and patterns where none exist, altering pictures to change their meaning and quoting apocryphal works and offering speculation as fact in such a way that the same method could probably also be used to prove that the secret child of Top Cat and Judy Jetson is the true heir to the throne of Great Britain, but at least the film's hero is allowed to puncture some of the more absurd elements as pure conjecture or disproven nonsense (provoking the inevitable "That's what they want you to think!" response) before finally seeing the light. There's also something rather na?ve in the story's belief that if the big story is finally revealed, all war and sexual oppression will disappear overnight, something only underlined by the killer's over-the-top final moments.<br /><br />It's generally well cast (even if Tom Hanks pronunciation is a little odd at times while actors like Jean-Pierre Marielle are wasted on nothing parts) and has a surprising amount of momentum and drive before things slow to a crawl for the lengthy epilogue, while Hans Zimmer throws in an effective score, making for a surprisingly entertaining cinematic scavenger hunt.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>5 of 5 stars for the movie The Da Vinci Code. This is the first of (currently) three books in the Robert Langdon series. Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a specialist in symbology (the history and meaning of various symbols from different cultures. Langdon is called to help the police in Paris with a murder. This starts a long chain of events in which various religious factions are chasing "the Holy Grail". Langdon gains the help of a police officer who is the daughter of the murder victim. As the complex puzzle grows, Langdon reaches out for help from an old friend. This chain of events has several surprises as we learn some people are not who they appear to be (e.g. the lead police detective is actually a member of one of the religious factions and is trying to frame Langdon for the murder). Even Langdon's old friend is not exactly who he appears, nor is his butler! Complex, interesting, exciting and compelling is this story. Langdon is no James Bond, but, he does well during action moments. Langdon somewhat reminds me of Indiana Jones; college profession who has interesting adventures with historical artifacts and legends.<br /><br />A shout-out to Ron Howard for outstanding Direction of this movie! I feel the movie was totally faithful to the book. The last 5 minutes of the movie is totally wonderful (from Langdon's shaving accident). I can watch it over and over. On the Blu-Ray, there are details on how this scene was created. Simply Wow!<br /><br />Much has been written and debated over the historical validity of Brown's story and assertions. If you set aside those various debates and opinions and just take it as a story of fiction, it is a very good movie! I highly recommend this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>THE DA VINCI CODE is impressive filmmaking. Director Ron Howard employs an entirely new approach with this one. This is an epic film on a small scale. It is subtle, reverent and quiet, ever so quiet! I try to never compare a novel to a film or visa versa. They are just two completely different mediums of telling a story and each has its strengths. This film is a visual delight. Tom Hanks' performance is one of the most restrained I have ever seen for a main character in a film yet he maintains control by the nature of his well-defined character. Ian McKellen is quite the flamboyant counterpart to Hanks, yet who comes off best at the conclusion being the most levelheaded? Jean Reno gives a very restrained and dedicated performance and one of true conviction to his character, which helps this film immensely. Hans Zimmer's score is once again on target and he seems to be getting better with each film. This is a story of fiction and a good one. It felt good to sit down and just savor each scene instead of being assaulted by extravagant in-your-face explosions and noise. I truly liked this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>This is great fimmaking. Ron Howard breaks new ground with this one. This is an epic film told with subtle and quiet style. The cast is very good. The score is very good too. There are twists and turns but it never becomes too obvious because of Howard's direction. I will not compare it to the book. Not fair really. I liked this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I have seen so many bad * 1/2 and even one star reviews for this movie and the only review that got things right is the **** review I saw by the New York Post. Once I saw that **** review I thought many other reviews like that would follow. However I guess everyone else that gave it bad reviews are either overly Christian or have short attenion spans. Since some either complain about the length or the story itself. I even heard something about over-acting. Funny, I don't recall much over-acting here.<br /><br />  There's also reviews about it be boring with too much talking. Sure it's  convenient that they can get out every single thing they wanna say about history unknown to mankind before they are in danger again. However the book was like that too. Plus I didn't find all the talking boring. It' is faithful to the book and if everything the book says wasn't explained, the people watching the film that didn't read the book would be lost.<br /><br />  Besides listening to Ian McKellen talk in any movie isn't boring and of course it's not boring here either. Everything he says about Jesus may be silly and offending to some but....IT's FICTION!. People can be like "oh no, tell me he didn't just say that". When what is really so bad about what is being said ? I think it's selfish to just want to think that Jesus possibly couldn't of had a wife and kids and to totally be appauled by the thought. It doesn't make him any less special to me if it's true. Besides like I said...this is FICTION!, so hating the book and now the movie is the real silly thing. I think everyone that gave this bad reviews had it planned to hate it in the first place.<br /><br />  Yes the screenplay is done by Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay for Batman & Robin. So of course critics had to throw that in there and say the movie sucks because of that too. I too expected the film to suck once I learned that but come on, there's no Batman & Robin like dialogue in this film. Of course the guy that wrote Batman & Robin isn't as good of a writer as Dan Brown but he doesn't do a bad job bringing Brown's work to the big screen either. If you're mad that he chose to have all the talking from the book then that's silly too.<br /><br />  The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debators. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want  a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful and if the film wasn't soooo unfairly hated it would get  a best score nomination like it deserves. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Of course, one couldn't help but have very low expectations for The Da Vinci Code. Critics have been unmerciful.  Ron Howard was an odd pick for director.  Tom Hanks? He lacks sufficient gravitas (and in my book, acting ability, for the lead).  And can anyone understand all of what Audrey Tautou says under that thick, albeit authentic, accent?<br /><br />And yet, despite Ron Howard's penchant for the obvious and mundane, and Hanks' very low-key performance, The Da Vinci Code draws you in.  It's entertaining.  It isn't (thankfully) half as expository as it could have been. (Hanks seemed so strikingly unphysical and, moreso, unmasculine, that I started thinking he might be ill -- and trying to hide it.  He seemed slow and bloated, and simply not up to the task.)<br /><br />The book was pretty good, and so is the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Today I went to watch the Ron Howard movie The Da Vinci Code, a film based upon the novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, whom you may remember from previous Ron Howard films, and Audrey Tautou, best known for her work in Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain. Also making an appearance: Sir Ian Mckellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany, and Alfred Molina, amongst others....plus, the Louvre and its art, the streets of Paris and London, and several scattered abbeys, churches, cathedrals, and country estates.<br /><br />Given that it is a detective thriller, the movie's strengths are, expectedly, in its plot, which keeps things moving forward fast enough, so that folks don't necessarily have a moment to think on the strength of the evidence itself...except when Hanks' character himself questions it from time to time. Flashback scenes are the mode employed to add some history and depth to the main characters...there would have been no other way possible to have accomplished that, given the self-propelling storyline.<br /><br />The major premise of the plot is what has caused all the controversy. I'm not going to get into that here...no spoiler warnings necessary. For me, not being a religious man, and I'm not offended by this premise. To those who might be, please remember that it is just a movie, and there is no evidence to back up the premise (that I'm aware of)...and that the role of women in the Faith deserves some discussion from time to time, so make use of that time now.<br /><br />This film reminded me of the Ninth Gate, in ambiance and flavour. On the whole, I enjoyed it...there was a little more thinking involved in the watching experience than I've had in a little while.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I expected to be incredulous, but the screenplay and Howard's attention to crucial setting and details didn't allow for any disbelief. Every aspect of the characters was honed until the stage presence brought the viewer to the edge of the reality/imaginery fold. The story brings out the depth of the dimensions of history and I loved the thrill of chasing the clues (I hadn't read the book yet). Pondering all the assumptions about the possible meanings of different symbols added extra intrique. The screen version certainly doesn't top the novel, but it is a delightful enhancement of a terrific story. Great casting, great directing, great movie!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>I couldn't get away from The DaVinci Code even when in Japan.  The paperback edition were on display at bookstores everywhere and there were posters for the movies on the pillars of Tokyo's subway station.  Upon returning home, I forced myself to read the book before taking a gander at the movie.<br /><br />For those sheltered from the realms of pop culture (which may not be a bad idea):  while giving a lecture on symbols in Paris, Dr. Robert Langdon, a professor is enlisted in aiding the police in the murder of Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, who has been found dead a la DaVinci's Vitruvian Man or Canon of Proportions.  Sauniere also wrote a cryptic message that Bezu Fache, the DCPJ (Direction Centrale Police Judiciare) officer in charge of the investigation, wants Langdon to find out.  Langdon finds an ally in DCPJ  cryptologist Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of the murdered, with whom she has not been in contact for a long time.  The duo are on the run, as Fache has already pegged Langdon as the murder suspect.  Another party, in the form of the menacing albino monk Silas, under the guidance of Bishop Aringarosa of extreme Catholic organization Opus Dei and a mysterious person known as the Teacher, is also after our heroes.  He takes an extreme form of Christianity, flogging himself and even wearing a spiked discipline belt (cilice) around his leg.<br /><br />While comparisons have been made to Raiders of the Lost Ark (the quest for the Holy Grail), the DaVinci Code is more a thinking movie given the codes Langdon and Sophie have to decipher, and the wily intellect of Jacques Sauniere is demonstrated time and time again with each clue solved, be it through anagrams, codes, or Fibonacci numbers.  Langdon and Neveu follow clue after clue, from the Louvre, to a Swiss bank account, to the Templar's church in England.  They also get help from Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric British Grail historian whose passionate and enthused performance by Ian McKellen makes for one of the greatest moments in the movie.  It's gratifying to see heroes and characters whose chief assets are their brains, not whether they can kick a 50 ft steel wall down and kickbox their way through 50 bad guys dressed in black in a digital blur.<br /><br />Tom Hanks does a competent job as Langdon, though check out that hairdo!  I was initially disgruntled upon hearing Audrey Tautou (Sophie) costarring.  She's finally sold out, I thought, but after seeing her competent and likeable character plus a glimpse of that smile I remember from Amelie, much of my rancor evaporated.  And since going Hollywood, poor Jean Reno (Fache) seems relegated to second banana roles as the token French official--remember The Pink Panther.<br /><br />The controversy that set the Vatican abuzz is nothing new--q.v. The Last Temptation of Christ, which somewhat dwells on the same theme.  But it does make a point of how history and thus truth is a commodity created by the winners, at the cost of keeping the real truth hidden from the rest of the world, often innocent lives.  The historical flashbacks demonstrating the holocaust perpetuated against freethinking women burned as witches and the hunting down of the Templars by the Church exemplify that.  In Langdon's lecture, we see how Poseidon's trident is turned into the devil's pitchfork and how Mary nursing Jesus was taken from a representation of Isis nursing Horus, basically how Christianity was founded on distortions, appropriations, and suppressing concepts from pagan religion--we have Emperor Constantine to thank for that at the Council of Nicaea.  So dark the con of man indeed.<br /><br />Being a somewhat harsh judge when it comes to movies based on novels, there was quite a bit of material excised from the movie, but 85% of the book was there, so given today's shoddy standards, not bad.  Granted, there are some extraneous stuff in the movie not in the book--the scene at the park where Sophie pays 50 euros to the drug addict to have the park bench to herself and Langdon.  The book's better, obviously, but as movie adaptations go, a hand to director Ron Howard.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>The length is a little punishing (said the Nun to the Bishop), but I thought this was rollicking good fun for the most part. UK viewers may titter when Audrey Tautou first appears talking like Michelle from vintage BBC comedy 'Allo 'Allo ("Listen very carefully; I shall say this only once!") and even wearing the same coat. Director Ron Howard's approach - hokey melodrama but on a tight leash - works surprisingly well.<br /><br />I am not religious but I was very touched by its sentiments.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous and recognizable portraits ever painted, so it is appropriate that it is tied to one of the most recognizable pieces of fiction to come along in decades. The painting remains the subject of speculation; some believe Leonardo used himself as a model, others that the woman was a mistress of his patrons. The Da Vinci code creates much the same amount of speculation. Like viewing the enigmatic work by Leonardo in which the exchange between the viewer and the work itself is mesmerizing, engrossing, so it is with the Da Vinci Code. The blockbuster screen version of the historically successful-best-selling book about the frantic Euro-scavenger hunt to unlock a 2000-year-old secret. You must know the story by now it's been on the best-seller list longer than the last 2 Potter books. Okay, just incase...World-renowned Harvard symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) is called to a murder investigation, of which he becomes a suspect in, at the Louvre Museum. The museum curator has been murdered, turning his remains into a living symbol, well not living, turning his remains into a symbol that will lead Langdon and police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on the run and on a trail of clues and symbols leading to many secrets worked into the art of Leonardo Da Vinci, tied to a secret society dedicated to guarding the ancient secret. I know even if you haven't read it or seen.<br /><br />The Movie, like the book, has all the style and traditional suspense elements that make a movie of the genre work as an entertaining narrative, taking the viewer along with confidence that it is going one almost mainstream way (really? Secret societies & killer albino monks!!), then surprising you when it doesn't. It feels real familiar as a thriller then events twist and turn another way.<br /><br />The international cast is lead by 2-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, who, with his stringy academic hair, embodies Dan Brown's protagonist for the film. Symbologist Robert Langdon is described early in the novel as being sort of a "Harrison Ford in Harris tweed" and Hanks is a solid choice (inspite of the fact that I would like to see Director Ron Howard draw from outside his personal actor's pool, casting an unknown is always a gamble). Langdon is the thinkin' man's hero, relentless in his quest to seek out the truth. Audrey Tautou , plays Sophie Neveu,  the strong partner with just as much personal as well as proffession at stake in solving the mystery. Also in Howard's ensemble cast is Sir Ian McKellen who delivers his typically brilliant portrayal as the enigmatic Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany, who appeared in Howard's Beautiful Mind, plays the bizarre monk Silas. Finally Jean Reno, plays French police captain Bezu Fach, a part written for Reno, literally, Dan Brown wrote the character with the French actor in mind!! Lastly but not least, Alfred "throw me the idol" Molina (Doc Oct in Spiderman 2) plays the Bishop Aringarosa with creepy distinction.<br /><br />Be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel and part of the fuss over it has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden "history" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church.<br /><br />See it, if for nothing other than to see the amazing BONDish locations, historical attractions and real (sometimes) works of art featured in the film. Location including: Paris' Musee du Louvre (the footage of the Louvre at night is beautiful), the Temple Church (of the Knights Templar), Westminster Abbey, Lincoln Cathedral (London) , Rosslyn Chapel (Scotland), Lincolnshire substituting for Castle Gandolfo, the Mediterranean island of Malta. Locations and art included give a much-needed authenticity that would have been lost on a backlot or soundstage shoot.<br /><br />Overall the film is definitely worth the price of admission but, be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel. Part of the fuss over CODE has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden "history" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church. This may anger Christians in general, Catholics in particular, especially those not willing to treat the film as fiction based on controversial theory. I for one am a Roman Catholic and find the material, of both the film and novel, fascinating and worth my time.<br /><br />Another warning due to the complicated exposition of the story the Da Vinci Code runs over 2 hours and many plot points necessary cause the film to drag at times. It has a Pg-13 rating for violence, some sexual content, brief drug references and disturbing images and themes.<br /><br />Lastly, I recommend that other Christians and Catholics (with serious inquires) take advantage of the excitement (good or bad) generated by this movie and use the opportunity it provides for church dialogue. Many churches have responded positively (and some negatively) by arming their congregations with their history and theology, along with strategies to spread their faith. That is what good books and movies should do: inspire people to think and ask interesting questions.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />There are several serious "crimes" in movie making - unfunny comedy, unmoving drama, and non-thrilling and boring thriller/mystery. "Da Vinci Code" the movie has committed several of these crimes - as a mystery it is boring, as a thriller, it does not thrill, and its attempt to drama lacks any interesting characters I could care about. I am the last person to believe that the book was a work of art but it was fun to read. It was dynamic, well paced, and it gave (at least it tried) an insight to the characters' motivations and reasons. I don't even mention the references to history, Art, history of Art and religion that made the book one of the best selling works of fiction of all times whether we like it or not. How the movie made of that book happened to be lifeless, slow, and non-involving is beyond my understanding.<br /><br />If the most alive in the movie is Giaconda's (Mona Lisa's) smile and the rest of the characters all look and move like Zombies; if there is more chemistry and interest to each other between Christ and Mary Magdalene from Da Vinci's fresco "The Last Supper" than between Hanks's and Tautou's characters, and if the movie that takes place in the spectacular locations does not even look interesting, I'd say, "Houston, we have a problem." I have come up with my own grading system for the movies based on the options I have:<br /><br />From bad to so-so: Small TV with the cheap DVD player on the kitchen<br /><br />Good: Home Theater #1 - 42" Plasma and good sound system.<br /><br />Great: Home Theater #2 - Panasonic projector with huge screen and great sound system.<br /><br />Masterpiece: I wish I'd seen it in the theater.<br /><br />"Da Vinci Code" deserves to be watched on the kitchen while I make dinner or feed the birds. I would not miss much.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code opened amid a flurry of reviews, but most of the reviews were made before people even saw the movie!  I am only one person, but I actually DID watch the movie, and here are some of my thoughts.<br /><br />Q. Does it vilify the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei?<br /><br />A. Yes, if I were Catholic I would not like this movie.  Churches seem to be prime targets for attack these days.  Perhaps Christianity is one of the few scape goats left that can be used for villains without raising too much of a backlash.  Although I think this is changing and Ron Howard and Tom Hanks toned down the movie to the point that it is almost acceptable.  Most viewers will see this as more fantasy than an attack on the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Q. Is this movie Christian?<br /><br />A. No, it presents paganism as a viable belief system opposed to Christianity.  It presents Christianity as a source of evil in the world.<br /><br />Q. Is it historical?<br /><br />A. Hard to answer, it does contain historical references.  Some are true, some are debatable, and some have no scholarly basis at all.<br /><br />Q. Is it a danger to Christianity?<br /><br />A. No, the movie doesn't carry the same atmosphere of realism that the book carries.<br /><br />Q. Is it interesting?<br /><br />A. Yes, I went with several other people who had not read the book.  They all liked it and could follow the story line.  The monk, Silas, does an excellent part with his role.  Several of the other characters are well acted.  The movie is a little slow compared to the book, but keeps moving.<br /><br />My Final Analysis:<br /><br />This is not as good as some say and not as bad as others say.  It is a movie.  When all is said and done, that is how it will be perceived.  It is an excellent conversation starter.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code was a good book.  It kept me totally involved and I just couldn't put down.  Every page presented a new puzzle and, as a reader, I was able to make some educated guesses as well as stop and read a passage over again to make sure I understood.  I gave the book my highest rating and recommended it to all.  That's why I was anxious to see the movie.  I even bought tickets in advance for opening night.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes into the film I fell asleep.  I guess that says something.  But I did wake up and try to enjoy this flick.  I couldn't.  Actually I'm embarrassed for Ron Howard who I know to be a fine director.  And the stars, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, have also done better work in the past.<br /><br />The screenwriter tried to present all the puzzles that were in the book.  That was an absolutely impossible task.  On the big screen it comes out as one big jumble.  There are secret societies, a coded bank vault, a couple of different religious cults, and a question about whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene were every married and had a child. There are puzzles and puzzles and more puzzles to solve.  It's hard to tell who the good guys are.  But the main characters are some kind of geniuses because they constantly have brilliant thoughts;  and  then - poof - the latest puzzle is solved, only to be replaced by an even bigger puzzle.  There is no time to absorb all the details. The storyline is lost because of all the confusion.  Also, some of the film is in French and the titles are so big and so spread across the big screen that the concentration it takes to read them made it even harder to follow this convoluted story.  It was hard to stay awake.  I tried though.  I really wanted to like this film.  Instead I hated it.<br /><br />There have been a lot of protests by religious groups about this film.  Supposedly, it questions the very foundations of Christianity.  I don't think the Church has to worry though.  The story is so complicated that it is impossible to follow.  And besides, nobody ever said that this wasn't FICTION.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw the film.  I wanted to see for myself what all the hype is about.  I also think personal taste is developed by experimenting with a wide variety of different kinds of things.  So see it if you must.  But as far as I'm concerned, I give the film version of The Da Vinci Code my very lowest rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>I had mixed feelings after watching this movie.  One of course has to consider that the movie was competing with a extremelly successful book that everyone (despite if someone like it or not) had read it or had knowledge of it.  Thus the director, the script writer and the actors had a mountain to climb.<br /><br />The script deviates from the book in several aspects and pays little attention to the thinking of the players on solving the puzzle- although any film would compete rather poorly with a book in this aspect.  Having said that Ron Howard directed this film very well but I think that Tom Hanks was miscast for the leading role.  He is a great actor but he is not really the professor that Dan Brown described.  The rest of the cast perfomed quite well.<br /><br />All in all if you watch this movie without attempting to compare it to the book you could actually enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>Ron Howard create a masterpiese and even classic of adopting a film from a book in this movie. Places and characters are all exactly what i had in mind when i was reading the book. but thats not the best part. This movie is a real visual book by using shadows on unimportant and enhanced light on important and key parts of the quests and mysteries and you can feel them inside your mind. I'm not here to tell what's wrong and whats right. Jesus had a child? good for him. his child and blood is as good as Rob zombie to me. In the age of democracy and people's power there is no room for any Royal Blood. each drop of blood in each vein of any human is a royal blood.... but the movie sure is a masterpiese and we are talking about the movie itself, not the concept.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I'll begin by saying that with the exception of "Splash" I've never liked Ron Howard's films. While I admit that he's certainly a competent filmmaker, his movies are just too for-the-masses, formulaic and safe for my movie-viewing interests. But I went to see "The Da Vinci Code" anyway, mainly because I enjoyed the book (even though I think it's rather hollow and not the superior literary work so many say it is). And much to my surprise, I ended up really liking this adaptation. I think Howard has done a highly commendable job with transferring the book to the big screen. On the one hand, it wasn't an easy task, as so much takes place in the book in such a short amount of time. But on the other hand, it *was* an easy task, as the book reads like a movie script to begin with (we have to admit that). So in a way Howard already had all the pieces he needed (including most of the dialog); his job was simply to put them all together and create the finished product. But I'll reiterate that all in all I think he did a good job with it.<br /><br />This movie basically follows the book almost note-for-note, which some will argue is its strong point whereas others will argue the total opposite. I tend to go with it being a strong point. Howard never intended to reinvent the story nor add his own vision to it. It's as if he directed it through Dan Brown's eyes. Changing the story would have caused more uproar than the uproar caused simply by the movie being made in the first place. And changing the story would not have attracted Da Vinci Code-haters to the theaters. Simply put, this movie was made for fans of the book and nobody else. I've heard many people say that the movie is shallow. Well, so is the book. You take an average-looking person and stand them in front of a mirror and the person in the mirror looking back at them isn't going to be beautiful.<br /><br />Performance-wise, I have no complaints, although I found Jean Reno's portrayal of Fache to be extremely over-the-top and overdone. IMO Paul Bettany stole the show as Silas, even if they forgot to give him red contact lenses. Audrey Tautou was perfect as Sophie (and by the way, she can decipher MY code any day, and would quickly see that it spells out L-O-V-E). And of course, Tom Hanks as Langdon. Sure, there are other actors who could have taken on the role just as well. But Hanks does more than a competent job.<br /><br />Howard does make a handful of minor changes, although none compromise the story in any way. For example, he changes the way Silas attacks Langdon at Teabing's home. But one change I'd like to mention, a change that I feel benefited the movie a great deal, is Howard's decision not to have Langdon and Sophie hook up at the end. One thing about the book I hated was the hackeyed, almost obligatory and forced eventual hook-up of those two. Although Langdon and Sophie hint at a possible attraction in the movie, it doesn't go beyond that.<br /><br />I'll end by saying that this movie adaptation easily equals, if not slightly exceeds, the book. Again, if you thought this adaptation was hollow, read the book again and see that it's not that much different. So, I give this film 4 stars based on its own merits, but also based on Howard's successful transfer of the book into a visual medium without trying to outdo it. Take away from it what you will.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>The trouble with making a movie out of book so wildly popular as The Da Vinci Code is that we all knew (just knew!) it'd have problems. Detractors will lambaste it for the pages of the novel that had to be cast aside for the sake of film time (the movie is still 2 hours and 29 minutes, though) and any changes to characters or plots (all of which have happened.) But when you transfer a book to film, a certain amount of trust has to go to the screenwriters; a level of trust that basically says, "Please don't screw this up! But give us a good story that'll engage film audiences!"<br /><br />I've read The Da Vinci Code and I must say that the book was interesting, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I was continually astounded to see it on the bestseller list month after month after month. I kept asking myself, "Did I miss something? Was it really THAT good?" Maybe. Either way, however, I approached this film with a fairly high level of trepidation. "Will the movie be over-hyped, too?"<br /><br />I'm happy to say that this is an adequate film (thus my thumbs up rating.) But I don't believe it'll stay in theaters as long as the book stayed on the bestseller lists.<br /><br />The film DOES follow the book surprisingly well. Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He's in Paris autographing his latest book when a police officer approaches and asks him to come to the Louvre. Once there, Mr. Hanks discovers that a murder has taken place. A curator that Mr. Langdon was supposed to meet that night was murdered and his body desecrated. But it appears the dead curator desecrated his own body. But why?<br /><br />Sophie Neveu, a young detective played by Audrey Tautou, arrives at the scene and soon Mr. Langdon's life begins to unravel. Trapped by the French police, a murder investigation in which he is the prime suspect, a secret society of ultra-worshippers known as the Opus Dei, and a group of Templar Knights in hiding, Robert Langdon is quickly whisked into a life of puzzle solving in order to find a secret that could unravel Christianity as we know it.<br /><br />Much controversy surrounded the film before its release. The main controversy was from albinos. Amazingly I heard nothing from this group while the book was out, but now that the film is here, they've emerged from the woodwork. Why? I'll let you all think about that one on your own.<br /><br />There have been complaints, too, that the film is "too slow to get going" or that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou gave wooden performances. I didn't see that.<br /><br />I will complain about Tom Hanks in this role, however. I'm sure Ron Howard and he work together comfortably after their previous collaborations ...from SPLASH to APOLLO 13. But I just couldn't swallow Mr. Hanks as the prime character. There was zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Tautou, and his long hair was ...well ...nasty looking (like it needed a good washing.) He's getting up there in age and I think Clive Owen or some other up-and-coming actor would've been a wiser choice. My two-cents ...</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>Back in the late 80's a film from Martin Scorcese was released that caused much of what the Davinci Code is exhibiting today.  Catholics and Christians alike were up in arms about how sacrelige and morally irresponsible "The Last Temptation of Christ" was when it was released to theatres.  I remember being challenged by that movie since I was a devout Christian and struggling with the idealism of what Christianity was all about.  Looking hindsight, "The Last Temptation of Christ" helped me grow deeper with who God was to me rather than what he was to a church built by man's ideology.<br /><br />I believe things much differently 18 years later.<br /><br />Not because of a movie but because things like "The Last Temptation of Christ" made me ask the really tough questions that no one in any church really wants to ask.  Nor does anyone have a solid answer for.  So, "The Last Temptation of Christ" is considered probably one of my favorite movies of all time simply because it's thought provoking and means so much more now than it ever did back when I was impressionable and naive.  Aside from this review, I highly recommend "The Last Temptation of Christ" on DVD available from the Criterion Collection.<br /><br />As far as "The Davinci Code," it's really all relative.  Dan Brown has created a work of fiction to ask the really tough and outlandish questions and in the meantime, put a little spin on things to make people think or in this case, make people laugh &lt;not funny>.  It's not gospel.  It's not trying to be anything but a thought provoking joy ride into the big question, "Is your faith real?"  If so, why is it real?  How do you know?  What do you really believe?  Why do you believe it?  Unfortunately, "The Davinci Code" movie fails where "The Last Temptation of Christ" exponentially succeeds.  After watching "Davinci" I was simply unchallenged and bored.  Nothing in this movie exemplifies great story telling and isn't that what movies sort of need to suspend disbelief?  For those looking for 2 and a half hours of elite escapist entertainment, go see "MI:3" or wait until "Superman Returns," because this movie simply doesn't fit the bill!  This is definitely NOT a "summer" movie by any means and I am quite surprised the studios thought this worthy of a summer opening.  If you're a fan of the book, the movie follows along fairly well but doesn't exceed expectations.  Tom Hanks has finally made a dud film in his long line of hits.  You knew it had to happen eventually.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>The curator of the Louvre in Paris is murdered in the museum, leaving behind a series of cryptic messages for an American author and expert on symbols and ciphers. Along with the curator's granddaughter, a French policewoman, they must follow the clues while evading the police to uncover a secret that would change 2000 years of Christian history.<br /><br />Having read the book and enjoyed it, I was very disappointed in the movie. Maybe is just wasn't meant to be a film. There is a lot to explain as the story line moves along and Dan Brown was able to make it informative and exciting on the page. Unfortunately on the screen these scenes are long and dull. The movie on a whole was too long and for a thriller had very few thrills. The whole mood just didn't work, making everything happen too slowly to really engage the viewer. Even Tom Hanks, one of the best actors in the world, was not good in this movie. The only person that escapes unscathed is Ian McKellan who gave a believable, fanatic performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks is Robert Langdon, the walking bibliophile of ancient codes and symbols, who is implicated in the murder of one of the Louvre's curators, a man who himself is something of a mystery.  Brought to the scene of the crime without being told that he's a suspect, Langdon is shocked to find the body positioned according to Da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man", and more shocked to learn that the victim assumed this position himself before dying - a sort of final coded message between two men with a love for codes.  Warned of the suspicions surrounding him by Sophie Neveau (Audrey Tatou), the dead man's granddaughter, Langdon escapes and leads the police in a chase across France in a desperate gamble to learn the victim's last, greatest secret.  Soon, Langdon's pursuers come to include a homicidal monk dispatched by a Bishop of the reactionary order of Opus Dei, and all events are shown to have been manipulated by a mysterious character known as "Teacher".  As Langdon picks up clues, he begins to realize that the mystery may involve the legend of the "Holy Grail", and heads for the home of an old friend, Sir Lee Teabing, the foremost proponent of a particularly unique theory of Grail legend.<br /><br />Even giving the movie the same allowances as the book, DVC is a horrible movie, slow, pedantic and full of red herrings that no sane moviegoer will fall for.  The religious controversy surrounding DVC thinly masks the movie's two cardinal flaws - 1) that it takes itself way more seriously than it deserves (the world is full of distinct religions espousing wholly incompatible beliefs - are we to believe that an admittedly dramatic discovery on one of them will really change the rest of the world?  Also, assuming the secret was uncovered, DVC never clears up how it would be proven); 2) it's boring!  At over two hours (and boy, will you feel it!) the only secret uncovered is that it's possible to have both Ian McKellan and Tom Hanks in a movie lacking almost any energy.  Hanks is serviceable as Langdon, Dan Brown's factotum of symbols nobody really cares about.  KcKellen chews up the scenery as Teabing, but ultimately the pointlessness of his character overwhelms McKellen's presence - whether you buy into his theories or not depends largely on the same degree of faith as the religion that Teabing assails.  The flick telegraphs its thrills - my wife and I were able to guess what would happen next, who would say what, etc...  The novel excelled because skillful pacing kept the action from being overwhelmed by the hot air of its long theories.<br /><br />The film plays down the novel's attacks on the Church for a more sustained atmosphere of religious antipathy (from disfavored apostles to Isaac Newton, if you've got a mind of your own, the Church hates and fears you, a bit of low-grade demagoguery that the script takes for granted).  To add insult to injury, DVC treats the Church as irrelevant (despite their wealth and power, the clergy in DVC are relegated to being unwitting pawns of a higher, if more temporal power).  But as I said, the story's attack on religion is itself a smokescreen hiding the fact that DVC is simply inert.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Little did Robert Langdon know that he would be defining his own quest when he stated:<br /><br />"Understanding the past determines actively our ability to understand the present. So how do we sift truth from belief? ... How do we penetrate years, centuries of historical distortion to find original truth? Tonight this will be our quest."<br /><br />Jacques Sauni&egrave;re (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is killed for a secret. He leaves a mysterious message for Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). Langdon and Sauni&egrave;re's granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) become partners in a hunt for the Holy Grail. But time is running out for them as they are being hunted down by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) for murder. Whom can they turn to for help? Maybe Sir Leigh Teabing (Brilliantly played by Ian McKellen.)<br /><br />This film relies heavily on the viewer reading the book before viewing.  Sometimes they go out of their way to follow the story. At other times, we get a Ron Howard interpretation of Dr. Robert Langdon and his amazingly distracting hairstyle. Other than that, it is better than not having a movie at all. And as with all formula stories, it is always the last person you would suspect.<br /><br />The extra features can get a little boring as they keep repeating the same thing overt and over in sound-bite form. They keep talking about people that never made it on the film but never say that these people are or show their tryouts.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385504209">The Da Vinci Code</a><br /><br />Angels and Demons [Blu-ray]</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>It's a fish, folks. A stiff, cold one wrapped in last Sunday's ads. "The Da Vinci Code" is a buttoned-up bore, a prestige picture so prude most scenes could have staged at the community playhouse. Director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and every single actor colors completely inside the lines of Dan Brown's novel. The book works because the camera is our imagination. The movie captures little of th aura, momentum or controversy found in Brown's pages.<br /><br />Challenging the divinity of Jesus Christ by claiming he married Mary Magdalene and fathered children, "The Da Vinci Code" was an effective piece of historical fantasy because it compressed its story into 24 hours, played fast with the truth (such as relying on Gospels written 200 years after the death of Jesus) used intriguing locales (The Lourve, Westminster Abbey) and dared to villanize a real Catholic organization (Opus Dei) as mastermind of a conspiracy to suppress, as several characters call it, "the sacred feminine." The secret is revealed when a hooded albino monk (Paul Bettany) shoots the curator of Louvre -who has time before dying to tip off Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist grannddaughter Sophie(Audrey Tautou) that his murder is more meaningful than it seems. Chief inspector Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) has reason to suspect Langdon is the killer. Sophie, working off her own clues, knows better.<br /><br />The movie then shifts into a lengthy scavenger hunt for, yes, The Holy Grail, protected by the Priory of Sion, a ancient religious sect that included Da Vinci and Sir Issac Newton among its members. The Grail is not a cup, but Jesus' bloodline, as Langdon and Sophie discover from British grail historian Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen). It's Teabing, hobbling about on canes in his cavernous mansion, who lays out the movie's conspiracy theories in a 20-minute lecture that includes flashbacks and microwave history. It deserves a small refutation.<br /><br />To quote Hanks, the material peddled  here is "hooey," but, taken sincerely, it begs a serious question - if Jesus was married, and thus not the son of God, does it matter whether he has a bloodline? Goldsman and Howard make some effort to inject a certain character with healing abilities that suggest Jesus' miraculous powers, and in fact the movie needs Jesus to be just who the four Gospels found in the Bible say he is - a prophet, a martyr, sinless. But the Jesus presented in those Gospels is not married, except to his "bride" in Revelation: The church of his believers. Though Brown's book more clearly wants readers to consider the Gnostic position (that Jesus was not, as the Gospel of John claims, the word become flesh, but the word *and* the flesh) the movie cannot argue that without taking yet another ten minutes to jabber. In other words, it's no "JFK" in presenting its alternate reality.<br /><br />Which is permissable, cinematically, if "The Da Vinci Code" pulsed with hot blood. But Howard buries his actors beneath the screenplay. The ghostly, grainy flashbacks seem borrowed from the History Channel or Unsolved Mysteries. The photography, courtesy Salvatore Totino, is serviceable but phony - the shadows are manufactured, the exotic locales touristy. Again and again, Howard relies on reaction shots, needless closeups, and a domesticity born out of, yes, the nature of the screenplay, but also Howard's recent habit, since beginning work with Totino, to put scenes inside a concentrated, austere box of drama, as he intends an actor to say in every scene, "I need to believe a miracle can happen." Howard is of the right demeanor for "The Da Vinci Code" - his movies aren't exactly faint, and some of his better efforts (the first half of "Ransom," "The Missing") almost seem to slide a solemn tint on their camera lenses - so it's fair to assume he divined a path to daylight and a $500 million worldwide box office and directed the squarest picture he could imagine. Its dull polish isn't even completely tangible; it's simply immediate and pitiable.<br /><br />Hanks acts he showed up and took orders as Robert Langdon. He walks, runs, squints - his lips even move. Truthfully, Hanks lacks the arrogance to invest in half-baked academic wit, and that rare talent to make the inane - "I have to get to a library, fast"  - sound urgent. His co-star, Tautou, has the presence and beauty, along with the most infectious grin in movies.  A shame she gets to use it only once, in the movie's only clever joke. McKellen is starting to slip into Anthony Hopkins country. And the less said about Bettany's bizarre monk - his Latin brogue and welt-ridden body - the better.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Lukewarm' is the word to describe the latest collaboration of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. Even the avid fans of the actor would admit `The Da Vinci Code' is not his best movie, turgid and bloated, far cry from the thrills of `Apollo 13.' Whatever the sin the film committed, it is not about the religious content of the original book that caused some controversy because the film, knowing the risk they are running, avoids offering the definite solution to the `code.' That's OK, I understand. But if the film fails to entertain us as thriller, mystery, or whatever it is, that's something I cannot forgive<br /><br />The extraordinary plot of the book is brought to the screen, and it became more impossible, even ridiculous at times. The murder of a curator in Louvre brings two principal characters Prof. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveau (Audrey Tautou) to the museum. They are so clever that they can crack the elaborate codes left on the crime scene within ten minutes. but what is the fun of watching the mystery solved so easily? Or what kind of a murder victim can think of leaving such elaborated message while he is dying?<br /><br />[SAVED BY A PIGEON] From the weak beginning, the film never gets better. There is a brief, unexciting car chase in the Paris streets (by Audrey Tautou's cryptologist ... do you believe that?). The `bad' guys are represented by Silas, fanatical believer and assassin played by over-the-top Paul Bettany, and Bishop Aringarosa, miscast Alfred Molina. When the professor is in danger, he is miraculously saved by a pigeon. But Tom Hanks seems comfortable with this unbelievable situation, even with his terrible haircut.<br /><br />But what is most shocking to me is the disappointing acting from two French actors - Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno. You don't find the charming Amelie or Mathilde, or the super-cool Leon. They are surely doing their best, but clearly they are not comfortable with the roles they are playing, knowing that they should be doing films with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Luc Besson.<br /><br />The only winner in the film is Ian McKellen, whose witty and amusing acting as eccentric Sir Leigh Teabing, suddenly lights up the imagination of the cardboard characters that peopled the film, and makes them more tolerably human. Tom Hanks seems enjoying acting with him, and even willing to let him steal the scenes.<br /><br />After all, `The Da Vinci Code' is not as bad as you might be led to believe. It is gorgeous to see, and as I said, there is Ian McKellen's delightful performance. But the overlong film does not offer the thrills of encoding and decoding; it only gives us bits of mediocre mystery, bits of familiar family drama, and not-so-fresh conspiracy theory. And it works as none of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I'm not a Christian, have no interest in converting, although I do have a tattoo on my ankle of rosary beads, and a crucifix, which will probably be considered sacrilegious. (But if Nicole Richie has it, then damn, so can I!) But I am interested in the whole idea of the "Son Of God" having a child. I went to the cinema to see Passion Of The Christ, and own it on DVD, and I'll probably buy this on DVD too.<br /><br />I have bought the book (for dead cheap), but am saving it for my holidays, for something to do while I'm lying in the sunshine. For those reviewers who say you'll not be able to follow the film if you haven't read the book - rubbish. I went with someone who hasn't read the book also, and we managed to follow it all right I guess. But at 149 minutes long, you don't wanna be drinking during this.<br /><br />I was quite interested in all the little puzzles in this, and how everything was eventually pieced together. It did get my curiosity going, although I did find it slightly predictable, when they mentioned Jesus had a child, but I'm gonna keep it zipped it here.<br /><br />Everyone who has read the book, or seen the film, will know the storyline already, but basically some guy dies, but before he does, he leaves a bunch of clues for the granddaughter he hasn't seen in years (Audrey Tatou), and some Professor, who claims not to know him that well (Tom Hanks.) There's an albino monk, who just appears for no reason, and keeps self flagellating - not a pretty sight, and will take you straight back to viewing Passion Of The Christ. And there are a few others, some ambiguous characters, who help the film stretch out to 149 minutes.<br /><br />In my opinion, you're gonna believe what you wanna believe, but all the hoo-ha about this film, and protestors & such, is just too over the top. But also to me, this film felt like one big lecture about Christianity, and everything linked in to it. Some of the dialogue was so monotone, and very boring, I actually switched off during some of it. (And still managed to follow the film.) Could they not have made it seem a bit more lifelike, it sounded sometimes like the characters were reading straight from the script! C'mon guys, jazz it up a bit, start rapping or something! Now that would be a sight.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I quite believe the whole Mary Magdalene having Jesus' child, and him having descendants. He was a young guy, do we really wanna believe he died without experiencing stuff like this? Nah. To me, it's all true, but people will believe what they want, but just shove it down our throats alright?<br /><br />This film is going to be one of the biggest films of the year, simply because there is so much hype surrounding it. But don't believe the critics who reviewed it negatively because they felt they had to, see it, and see what you think of it yourself. Don't let anyone influence your opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>Wait for it on video. Not worth going to see on the big screen and spending the cash.

Ron Howard may religiously follow the text but the end result is a lifeless movie with the actors going through the motions but eliciting little energy in this mildy sacrareligious whodunit?<br /><br />I really don't know why the Catholic Church pitched such a fuss over The Da Vinci Code.  It is first and foremost entertainment.  Anyone who seriously takes the Priory of Sion or the tangled web of deceit that Dan Brown portrayed coming down through the ages needs to read a little more history on the subject.  Nevertheless, it is a compelling story and one that forces you to rethink the role of the church in obscuring the birth of Christ.<br /><br />Dan Brown was at his most compelling when exploring the role of the Sacred Feminine and how the imagined Merovingian line had been protected through the last two millennia by a secret order that apparently influenced popes and kings alike.  Brown casts Opus Dei in a sinister role which I guess is what raised hackles in the Church, moreso than the supposed bloodline of Christ, which has long ago been dismissed as the folly of a Frenchman, Pierre Plantard, who believed he was the descendant of Christ and the rightful heir to the throne of France.  He is the one who apparently concocted the Priory of Sion to give creedence to his claims,  You can read more about Plantard on wikipedia.<br /><br />But then that really isn't the point of the movie.  We are forced to follow our less than dynamic duo through a series of highly questionable and boring action scenes that ultimately lead them to the Rosslyn Chapel, where a resolution of sorts takes place.  I would have liked to have seen a little more of the Sacred Feminine come out in the movie, but it was too much about Professor Langdon and not enough about the role Sophie Neveu played in all this.<br /><br />Ron Howard should stick to "Grinches" and "Beautiful Minds," as he clearly was not up to the task of delivering on the theme.  A movie is not supposed to be a literal interpretation of a novel, especially one as dubious as this one.  It is supposed to have fun with the theme, explore new opportunities and be entertaining.  All of which this movie fails to do.  I give two stars mostly for Sir Ian McKellen, who at least had some fun with the role of Sir Leigh Teabing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I did not think from the beginning that Hanks was the best choice to play Langdon, and having seen it I still don't think he was.

Tom Hanks does an excellent job as Robert Landon, who seems to be mysteriously blamed for the murder of a curator in the Paris Louvre art museum.  He is relentlessly hunted by the police like the recent Jason Bourne movies and seems to escape by the skin of his teeth or through sheer luck.<br /><br />The movie makes clear that there is no church

Vinci Code was released as a book in 2003 and has been getting more and famous as time went on,now 3 years latter its made in a movie in 2006.What makes it so controversial is the book is basicly about religion and what the church tried to hind from you and stuff ,its all fiction but its a good book/movie.<br /><br />Sure some will find this movie outrageous because this is contradicting what they beleved for all their lives and the media attention The Da Vinci Code is getting will make that many people will see it and many disagree.But you got to keep in mind thats its fiction.Its controversial because its about religion and religion is something that nobody can handle because we all have our toughts and people think differently from you.<br /><br />For the movie itself now:The Da Vinci Code supports the idea of the the holy grail and that Jesus maried Mary Magdalene it is why its getting that much attention.The movie is about enigmas all along they have to solve to get to the next one.The movies is basicly around the death of Jacque Sauniere(got shot in the chest and had minutes to live) who is a well known cryptologist and when he died in the louvre museum he left ennigmas that would lead them to their quest of the holy grail.Robert Langdon teams up with Sophie Neveu(Jacque Sauniere is her grandfather)to decode what Sauniere has been tring to tell in the last minutes of his life.<br /><br />I read the book and i liked it i had expectations from this movie and it did well.The movie is 2 hours and 28 minutes and its long enough they putted as much as they could from the book cutting the less interresting stuff.Many who read the book tought it would be better as a movie.The action is a bit slow but Langdon and Neveu often get chased by the police and try to run away.<br /><br />There are different languages used in the movie and i saw the movie in english but there was a lot of french during the movie and those who dont understand french might find it frustrating cause you have to look at subtitles to understand at times.<br /><br />The movie can be very comfusing If you hadnt read the book it might be hard to understand,if you read the book then you should see the movie its worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Whether or not you believe in Dan Brown's mixture of historical facts mixed with a blend of hypotheses and extrapolations all bound up in a grand symbological mutli-million unit selling mystery novel(released in 2003)or not,is really of no consequence.The Roman Catholic Church whose foundation his novel questions was none too pleased at the time and(typical of the Church)issued memos to its' flock not to either read the book nor attend the subsequent movie's release.Of course,according to the Church,it was all bogus from beginning to end.Me thinks they did protest too much!<br />The movie takes Brown's writings and brings them to the screen in an intelligent and attractive manner all served up(and there is ALOT to serve up!)in a fast paced and unrelenting style that keeps you glued to the screen from the beginning to the very end.<br />The Da Vinci Code(released May/06) involves the story of a symbologist/cryptonalyst by the name of Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks).He is giving a lecture in Paris and attends a book signing after when he is approached by the police,one Capt.Fache(Jean Reno),to assist them in a murder that has just been committed in the Louvre.It turns out to be a friend of Langdon's by the name of Sauniere and the body has many mysterious symbols about it.Landon doesn't know it but the police captain suspects him of doing the dirty deed.A police cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou)arrives and gets Langdon alone.He is in danger she says and must leave and moreover the man who was murdered was her grandfather.<br />They escape and head to a bank with a key her grandfather left to her.It is a key to a safety deposit box which contains a small wooden box,in which is a cryptex.It is a cylindrical container surrounded with letters that must be arranged in a certain way to open it successfully.If not done properly a vial inside releases a potion of vinegar which destroys the contents.From here the pair seek out a Holy Grail expert-friend of Langdon's ,a Mr Teabing(Ian McKellan).They discuss the ins and outs of the Grail and the Church's earliest days and beginnings,right back to Christ himself and whether he was supernatural or just a man,when the police track them down.They all escape to London with the French police captain still in pursuit.<br />In London Langdon(assisted throughout by Neveu) tracks down an important clue to locate the Grail but they are confronted by Teabing who wants the box and cryptex it contains.Langdon turns away to try and decode the cryptex but when he turns back he throws it into the air which cracks the inner vile and destroys the contents.At this moment the police enter and Teabing is arrested,not Landon nor Neveu.It seems the French captain has been played for a dupe by the dark shadows of the Church who also want the Grail's location and he has come to his senses.Well,it turns out Langdon did indeed crack the code and has the parchment paper from inside.In it the directions lead them both to a Church in the countryside of England where they find that the Grail they seek was indeed once there but has been moved.However they also find the guardians of the Grail,a group dedicated to preserving the Grail and its' location.We also find out the Grail was/is Neveu herself;as she is from a royal blood line descended from Christ himself through Mary Magdeline his wife.The movie ends with much of the clues that have inundated Langdon's mind throughout his arduous journey,coming together and him walking to the front of the Louvre museum in Paris and kneeling and praying over the spot where the bodily remains of Mary Magdeline secretly lay.<br />The movie moves along at breakneck speed and  makes brief stops for the viewers to catch their collective breaths and try and take in much of what is going on before them.There are alot of clues and alot of information to digest here.But in the end the ultimate conflict here is again wrapped around a good guys-bad guys scenario.On the bad guy side is the Opus Dei depicted here as a shadowy form of the Vatican that is trying to keep hidden and even search out and destroy any vestige or hint of the Grail,i.e. the remains of Mary Magdeline and a possible bloodline.On the good side we have the keepers of the faith with the Priory of Scion and their more well known arm the Knights Templar.These guardians(and their many descendants)have fought the good fight for centuries in order to keep the truth alive,but hidden from harms way,i.e the Vatican.Brown's novel and the resultant movie never preach their story to us and let us make our own minds up.As I said before this story is based on old historical fact mixed with legends and the resultant extrapolations of the two.Near the end of the movie a conversation between Langdon and Neveu really says it all about the novel,movie and their goal.Langdon asks Neveu would revealing herself as a direct descendant of Christ bring about destruction of the Church or a new reconnaissance of it? Intriguing question to an intriguing....theory? Open minds is what it is all about.<br />This movie is one of Ron Howard's better efforts and deserves high praise for his deft handling of the complex material.The movie contains a solid roster of actors from Hanks,McKellan to French star Jean Reno and Germany's Jurgen Prochnow.Paul Bettany as Silas does a great turn as a conflicted and tortured puppet of the Opus Dei's bidding.<br />Technically the movie is presented in its original 2:40:1 aspect ratio and has been transferred wonderfully,sound included.Extras abound in this two disc set.We have featurettes "Filmmakers Journey Pt's 1 & 2",Music of the DC",a DC demo DVD game,"Portrait of Langdon","Who is Sophie Neveu?","The Usual Suspects","Magical Places","Close up of the Mona Lisa",a discussion with Dan Brown,first day on the set with the director and a look at many of the hidden codes placed smartly throughout the film itself.Everything you wanted to know about the DC but hadn't even thought to ask!<br />All in all a well done and intriguing thriller/novel brought deftly to the big screen by Ron Howard and now to DVD,in a fast 141 minutes.It's a solid cast and a highly recommended film worthy of repeated viewings to catch many of the clues that you may have missed the first time.Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I did not like this movie at all.  The book was absolutely phenomenal so, of course, I was looking forward to the movie.  This movie is a thriller with no thrills, an intellectual mystery with no mystery or intellect.  It's a film that, despite having good actors, setting and covering an interesting topic, is a commercial flop.  Tom Hanks, the protagonist, perhaps interprets one of the worst roles of his career, and there is little connection between him and Audrey Tatou as a couple.  She, incidentally, has a mediocre performance too. In short, The Da Vinci Code, a high budget film with good actors, is long winded, banal and mediocre.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I haven't read the book, I'm a catholic (not a very good one, but...) and I really had no preconceived notion about THE DA VINCI CODE before going in, other than the fact that lots of people were talking about it and it more or less bashes the catholic religion.<br /><br />There is one line in DA VINCI CODE that describes this movie in one sentence better than anybody can in a review. It somewhere along the lines of, "People rarely notice things right in front of their eyes."<br /><br />The genius of DA VINCI CODE is that, that line is so very true. We have been blinded by repetitive images. Television. Politics. Religion. We don't question, we just live and assume. Not only is that true, but the movie proves it with unmistakable evidence that will throw you for a loop and have you questioning your very lives.<br /><br />Anyway, THE DA VINCI CODE is ultimately, fiction. Yet, more than any other fiction to date, blurs the line of fiction and reality successfully. Despite all the things that are suggested in the DA VINCI CODE that would turn traditional religion on its ear, the movie pleads its case with great visuals, history, symbols, hidden meanings and unmistakable question marks hidden in real paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci.<br /><br />How many times have we've seen DaVinci's THE LAST SUPPER? Hundreds? Thousands? Yet, we are blind to the unmistakable questions that the movie poses about the painting. Sure, DaVinci obviously wasn't there at the time of the Last Supper, but it's still fun thinking about the questions his painting poses.<br /><br />THE DA VINCI CODE continues to pour on the evidence as the movie goes forward, leaving a lasting impression on your mind and your grasp of the stories we may or may not have been forced to believe throughout our lives. If anything, THE DA VINCI CODE, all be it fiction, stimulates the brain and makes you want to know more about Jesus Christ, Leonardo DaVinci and Mary Magdalene. That may be its greatest asset.<br /><br />After watching DA VINCI CODE, I find it hard to believe that there were so many bad reviews. Either they are people who are really really jaded and watch too many movies, or their religious types who are offended by the movies potential implications.<br /><br />The way I see it, God gave us brains so that we could walk, talk, think and help each other. He gave us rational thought so that we could decipher for ourselves what is right and wrong and not to just believe because we were told to.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's just a movie, and a darn good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: One of the most anticipated film projects in the last few years finally hits the big screen and comes flying out the gate. The Da Vinci Code had a huge opening weekend and earned $77 million, it also made film history by having the largest worldwide gross on opening weekend for any film ever made. Worldwide, the film grossed a massive $224 million against a budget of only $125 million in only 3 days. This is huge, so apparently all the negative reviews did not stop movie goers. Why did this film get trashed the way it did? It absolutely blows my mind that Poseidon has better reviews on Rotten Tomatoes than this film. Ron Howard provides a constant direction for the film and it never really gets off track. I found myself completely engrossed in the plot. It must have been a daunting task given that the book itself has sold over 60 million copies, and there is a huge fanbase awaiting this film. I have not read the book, but I know a few people who did and they all enjoyed the film and said it was a very faithful adaptation. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay was focused and very detailed even though some of the dialogue did make the film slip into melodrama in a few places. The movie was not necessarily thrilling, but it was very interesting and it always held my attention. A lot of people complained about its length, but never once in my mind when I was seeing it did I think that it started to drag. The film is really about this one man's personal journey through this entire ordeal. I could go into detail about the religious aspect of the film, but I won't because I think when people argue about religion it makes both sides of the argument look stupid. All the controversial stuff aside, this is a well made and very detailed film. It has great complex characters with lots of details within the plot with lots of historical references. When you get down to the basics of this movie, it's really nothing more than a hunt for the holy grail. I found it to be a great entertaining experience. There were a few editing choices that I was not fond of, some of the flashbacks were not handled well. Overall, it was a great hero's journey that comes full circle at the end.  I have to admit though, the film would have been incredibly dull if it weren't for Hans Zimmer's amazing score. Even though Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer, this is not a biased statement. For those who have seen the film, try and imagine the end sequence where the final revelation is revealed without the music. Lots of the scenes were heavily dependent on music and Hans Zimmer delivered an amazing score. There were some truly breathtaking cues in his score, and in the end the film was saved by the music.<br /><br />ACTING: I found the casting for this film to be perfect. Tom Hanks was a perfect fit for Robert Langdon in my opinion. He holds that intelligent poise that a brilliant professor would have. Audrey Tautou overacts just a tad bit at times, but then again one could blame the script's melodramatic dialogue. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Sir Leigh and at times steals the show. Other supporting work comes from Paul Bettany and Jean Reno. Bettany was terrific as Silas the albino monk and he really made him a dynamic character. At times he looked exactly like Ralph Fiennes from Red Dragon, just an observation that's all. Jean Reno was also geat as the detective who actually played the role that Dan Brown based on him. Dan Brown admitted that he wrote Reno's character with him in mind. Overall the cast is brilliant and full of great talent that make the characters come alive.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Right now Dan Brown is rolling in it, but in a way I think he justifyingly earned it. The Da Vinci Code is a great, entertaining, and intelligent story, and now Ron Howard has translated it into film which has given us a great story to experience on the silver screen. Great acting and a very detailed story make The Da Vinci Code an entertaining ride all the way to the end. There are times where the editing makes it feel awkward and you can tell there were some problems translating the book to film, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is a good film. It's not great, but it's not bad. I don't understand the mass hatred from all the film critics so far, I think the film has been attacked harshly for no reason other than it was hyped up to be so much more and didn't deliver on the rediculously high expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>A few months ago, I decided to lay my religious bias aside, and pick up and read Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code." And to my surprise, I really enjoyed it. Although I disagree with the books ideas and opinions, it was still a very well-written thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. But when I heard that the book was being made into a film, I was sceptical. Not because of the content, but that it would be hard to translate the book into a film.<br />Surprisingly, the film works. It's by no means a great film, but it is still pretty dang good. Where the film's drawback lies is in that it follows the book too closely.  But since the book is written in a way that not much can be changed, this weak-point can't be helped.<br />Tom Hanks and the cast do a great job of bringing the characters to life, while Ron Howard and the rest of crew do a commendable job behind the scenes. Kudos should especially go to Hans Zimmer, whose created a fantastic score, and the visual effects teams, who bring fantastical historical events and great imagery to the screen.<br />As for the film's message, it's presented as fiction. But it doesn't take either side. Langdon, who's character is slightly changed from the book, gives the movie's greatest line: "Is it possible that Jesus was a father, and still did all those miracles?" So, while it does question Jesus, it doesn't damn Him either.<br />Overall, "The Da Vinci Code" is a fine film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel. And, even though it is fiction, it is an opportunity to start a healthy debate on Who Jesus really was. May God bless you!<br />Movie Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>When Dan Brown's novel "THE DA VINCI CODE" was released back in 2003, the novel received plenty of criticism and scrutiny.  As the book would focus on "The Holy Grail" and the theory that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene and the Catholic Church has done all it can to cover that up.  Then upon the release of the film version based on the novel in 2006, the Roman Catholic Church and Catholics boycotted the film.<br /><br />If anything, the hype from the film earned the film $232.1 million worldwide during its opening, making it the seventh biggest opening for a film in history and also the second highest grossing movie in 2006 worldwide with over $758 million in profit making it the most financially successful film for both actor Tom Hanks and Director Ron Howard.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"THE DA VINCI CODE" on Blu-ray ala 1080p High Definition features a beautiful location shots in France and England and to shoot a film at the actual Museum de Louvre was surprising and very cool (and to learn how everything was recreated to scale and describe further in the special features).  There are really beautiful shots of the various locations throughout Europe and captured beautifully by Salvatore Totino.  Totino's insistence of using a Long Cooke S4 lens for diffusion filtering gave certain shots a nice, dark and brooding feel at times.  But during the outdoor scenes, the shots are absolutely beautiful.  Totino who made his major Hollywood debut with "Any Given Sunday" and working on films such as "The Missing" and "Cinderella Man" has been Ron Howard's go to man for cinematography.  Overall, well-done!<br /><br />The audio is also quite immersive and dialogue is crystal clear.  Primarily the film focuses on dialogue but once the action scenes start, as does Hans Zimmer's beautiful score.  You get good usage of all channels on your home theater through the Dolby True HD 5.1 soundtrack (English and French).  And its important to note that the film is not an action film but there are a good number of gunshots and chase scenes.  But what shines is Zimmer's Academy Award nominated score which sets the actual mood of the scene.<br /><br />Overall, "The Da Vinci Code: Extended Cut" looks and sounds awesome via High Definition.<br /><br />As for subtitles, English, English SDH and French are included.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Da Vinci Code: Extended Cut" is loaded with special features on two-discs.

How he worked with Ron Howard on "Backdraft" and how Howard wanted the music to come alive, like it was a character in the film.<br /><br />"THE DA VINCI CODE: EXTENDED CUT" was a thrilling, suspenseful film that in my opinion was smart, well-acted and managed to capture my attention for the entire length of the film.  But by saying that, it's unfortunate that this extended cut was not shown in the theaters, because those extra scenes of violence featuring Silas and the additional scenes make the film much edgier and understandable.  And the reason for the extended version not being used is probably due to its duration because this extended cut is 174 minutes long (original theatrical version is 149 minutes).<br /><br />And the film was not exactly well received by many critics because they felt Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman didn't take any risks, they didn't show any danger as seen in the original book by Dan Brown.With that being said, the extended cut makes a difference...  A big difference.  But whether or not you are open to film's premise is up to the viewer.  If anything, as Dan Brown had said in interviews, he wants the film to create intellectual debates.<br /><br />Multiple Academy Award winner Tom Hanks plays a likable Robert Langdon, a symbiologist who doesn't take things as is and has a mind that is constantly working overtime.  If anything, Langdon is an ordinary man who becomes a fugitive for a murder he doesn't commit.  He is a man that tends to doubt theories of history as stories could have been re-invented due to political and religious times.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou who charmed us in "Amelie" plays a convincing cryptologist Sophie Neveu is a person not religious but feels Langdon is her key to finding out who killed her grandfather.  Both Hanks and Tautou compliment each others performances but for those who expect more from Tom Hanks, may be disappointed that in this film, he is no action star but a Harvard professor that utilizes his skill and experience and nothing more.<br /><br />Jean Reno plays the side of the cop who takes things into his own hands, a role perfect for Reno and Ian McKellen absolutely shines as the obsessive Sir Leigh Teabing.<br /><br />There is no doubt that "THE DA VINCI CODE" would be a controversial film that would challenge the Catholic church.  Anything that challenges an established religion is sure to cause a ruckus and people are defensive about their religion and belief in God.  Especially when it comes to Mary Magdalene's status.  It will be forever debated of her role, if she was simply a devout follower of Jesus Christ or a loving wife that was kept secret and both have an extended line of children with the bloodline that exist today but is kept hidden.  Whatever your beliefs are or if your ability to suspend your beliefs and to see how the film (and its message) presents itself is up to the viewer.<br /><br />But the film seems to be one that one would either love or one would hate.  For me, I was entertained by the film and having watched multiple specials from 20/20 and on The History Channel regarding "THE DA VINCI CODE" and the theories that support and are against the theory is quite interesting.<br /><br />But what I found so inspiring was watching the Blu-ray and getting a feel of how much went into this film.  From recreating the Louvre, the production design coming up with over 125 paintings to recreate the museum to the actual props that had to be created and the many locations that had to be shot and the many sets that had to be created.  I was very impressed.<br /><br />The Blu-ray as I expected looks and sounds incredible and the special features featured on both discs alone are just outstanding.  So, overall, I felt "THE DA VINCI CODE" to be a very solid Blu-ray release.  But it's one of those films that it all comes down to the viewer if such a film can be watched over and over again, or if the film can be appreciated for its controversial storyline.  But as for the release itself, if you are into the filmmaking process or even a student in film, these are the kind of releases that you truly appreciate and enjoy.<br /><br />"THE DA VINCI CODE: EXTENDED CUT" is definitely worth checking out!</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>Boy howdy did the masses gobble this one up!  Tom Hanks is one of THEE finest actors of our time, but he could not even save it.

Jesus had a cousin whose sister had a nephew who married a truck driver that had another boy whose daughter married a guy a while back and now they live in Memphis.

I very much enjoyed the way that they adapted the screenplay (other than the end, obviously),and I loved the acting all around as a whole. That said Tom Hanks, obviously wasnt exactly the most convincing Robert Langdon but still his natural acting skills made up for it. Ian McKellen's performance of Sir Leigh Teabing is jut about as good as it could have been nd the French actress Audrey Tautou's performace as Sophie was well done.Even the little performances such as Jean eno's performance as the police chief was good just as the rest of eno's performances.

Akiva Goldman's script follows the book very closely with some changes including a different ending, and Ron Howard has assembled a talented cast.  The problem for me:  it was really rather dull, too cerebral to be considered an action or suspense movie, and Tom Hanks just didn't seem to inhabit his role as much as in previous films.<br /><br />Unless you've been on Mars for the past few years, you should know that the movie's central premise is that the Catholic Church is hiding a secret that if discovered would change the face of Christianity as we know it.  Whether you adhere to the suppositions posited by the movie or not, which I don't, you may be disappointed in the film's somewhat lethargic pacing and some improbable plot devices.  Audrey Tautou is okay as the heroine, but it's really Ian McKellen as the fanatical Priorist who steals the movie, but he's not in it enough to raise its level of excellence.  Jean Reno's detective is well done, but Alfred Molina is wasted in an unexplained role, while Paul Bettany's Silas is deranged but not fully recognized.<br /><br />All in all, THE DA VINCI CODE is an okay movie, but I was expecting something a little more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I had listened to the book on tape when it first came out, so I was already familiar with the story.<br /><br />The book was very confusing to me, I found it hard to follow. But I think the film was made in such a way that it was less confusing. Such as when Tom Hanks is going over the code, the letters or words highlight themselves as he goes along. Or when he is thinking through a problem, there is an impression of it that appears before him. All this makes it easier to understand.<br /><br />As for the acting, I thought both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were good in their roles. But I think the stand-outs for acting in this movie are Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina. Bettany sure has a difficult role as the monk who is after Hank's character.<br /><br />Also, I consider myself Christian and the movie and book didn't bother me. It is just Fiction after all, or just one person's idea. I like the fact that the movie leaves you thinking about religion and the meaning behind it, and shows that the people in the film believe in their faith very deeply. There are many scenes that address Jesus' Divinity and Humanity, and I think that is a good thing thing to show a movie audience.<br /><br />So there are a lot of issues in this movie that will really make you think about Jesus and religion. And it is very much a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>It is not a history book. If you object to it on religious grounds you certainly don't want to pique interest causing many people to rush out to see (or read) it. Faith does not trump facts or history. In The Da Vinci Code we may be dealing with pseudo-history. The idea that Jesus Christ, a Jewish man married as was Jewish custom, & had a child is more acceptable to me than a pagan Roman Emperor declaring Jesus divine 300 years after his death, with a book heavily edited by wealthy, white men concerned with holding on to their power.<br />  That said, enjoy this movie for the thriller it is with an interesting quest. There are a few twist & turns & it is pretty true to the book. The ending can be seen a mile off however. The makers of this movie played it safe casting Tom Hanks as the star. Someone a little less homogenized might have been preferred. But the carping by Catholics & others have guaranteed success.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Do what you are supposed do to, and absolutely nothing more.

I was really excited to see this movie. Despite the horrid reviews, I still thought the movie was going to be good because it was being based off of such entertaining source material. While the book was pretty crappy writing, it was definitely a page-turner. Throughout my reading of the book, I was constantly thinking what a great movie it was going to make. Turns out I was wrong...<br /><br />It's tough to describe what actually happened to make the movie so boring. I think it's because the writers stayed too true to the book. You'd think that would make a better movie, but what ends up happening is that we get a lot of pointless, annoying, unnecessary flashbacks along with a lot of drawn out, agonizing monologues from the main characters. In movie form, these methods of communication just don't really translate to exciting cinema. I sat stationary for pretty much the entire film. Never once was I excited. I know you're saying that of course I wouldn't be excited because I knew what was coming, but if a book to film transition is done well, watching the movie can be a whole new experience, and that definitely didn't happen here. I basically felt dead inside while watching the movie.<br /><br />I really did want to like this movie. In fact, at the end of the film the writers added on some dialogue between Robert and Sophie that made me want to like it even more. In this conversation, Robert talks about prayer, and "what matters is what you believe." Does it even really change anything if Jesus was married and fathered a child? I don't really have a set belief on that yet, but I am leaning towards no. The ending dialogue really showed me that the filmmakers just wanted to make a good movie. They failed, but at least they won't offend anyone by what they did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to admit that with all the hype surrounding the film I was expecting to see a masterpiece so when it turned out to be "just very good," I was taken aback.<br /><br />Without the hoopla and the unprecedented expectations that had preceded its release it could have easily been a 5 Star movie, but when expecting the entertainment produced by a LOTR type film anything less than perfect is a major disappointment.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and the rest of the amazing cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, while the film does not measure up to Dan Brown's book it is still definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>When will people learn to stop judging movies based off of the merits of the books?  Probably never, seeing as how I am guilty of that as well.  While I enjoy the Harry Potter films, I can't seem to get over how much better the books are.  Books and film are two very different media, and it is pretty much impossible to completely reconicle the two (though Sin City came very close).  I will admit that the book The DaVinci Code is much "better" than the film, but that doesn't make the film bad.<br /><br />Before I go into the explanation of the book/film debate, as well as the controversy of the film, I will first go over the story for the few of you who don't know it yet.  Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a renowned Harvard professor who is an expert in symbology, or the study of the meaning of ancient symbols.  While lecturing in Paris, France, he is contacted by the French police who tell him that they require his help in a murder case.  Earlier that night, Jaques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the curator of the Louvre, was shot and killed.  However, with his last breaths, he used a pen with ultraviolet-sensitive ink to write a message as well as cutting symbols into his own flesh and arranging his body to resemble Leonardo DaVinci's famous sketch, The Vitruvian Man.  The police are baffled by the fact that, instead of trying to identify his killer, Sauniere instead chose to leave cryptic clues.  Soon, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), a cryptologist for the French police, arrives to aid the investigation.  However, she is able to secretly pass off a message to Langdon in which she states that he is in danger; Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) erased part of the message that supposedly implicates Langdon in the murder, and Fache only brought Langdon in to force a confession.  Langdon and Neveu decide that, in order to decipher Sauniere's puzzles, they must escape, but in the process, they realize that the clues lead them to different paintings by DaVinci, eventually leading them to a special key bearing the mark of the Priory of Scion.<br /><br />Langdon explained to Sophie that the Priory of Scion is an ancient secret society dating back to the days of Christ, and that they are charged with keeping an ancient secret so powerful, that if it were to be released, it would shake the very foundations of the Catholic church.  Priory members have been hunted for centuries by church, hoping to prevent such a secret from coming out.  Numerous prominent historical figures are rumored to have been members, including Victor Hugo, Sir Issac Newton, and Leonardo DaVinci.  While Langdon was never sure he believed that the Priory ever actually existed, a monk named Silas (Paul Bettany), who is receiving orders from a Bishop (Alfred Molina), who in turn is getting his orders from a man known only as the teacher, ruthlessly hunts for Langdon and Neveu.  He is responsible for Sauniere's death, and he will stop at nothing to silence the Priory once and for all.  Rounding out the cast is Sir Ian McKellan, playing Sir Leigh Teabing, a biblical scholar.  Teabing is an old friend of Langdon, and he helps further explain the secret and its true power.<br /><br />Any problems the film may have definitely do not have to do with the actors.  Everyone involved gives great performances, especially McKellan, who seems to be able to do no wrong in his roles.  The "problems" have to do with the translation from book to film.  The story is, for all intents and purposes, a treasure hunt, with some very difficult clues linking the destinations.  In the book, the author isn't restricted by time limits, so Dan Brown was able to allow a lot more time for Langon, Sophie, and Teabing to decipher their clues, while giving Fache time to pursue his leads on finding the trio.  Ron Howard only has about 2 hours, and with so much story and expostion to get through, the characters have to figure things out a lot quicker in order to advance the plot.  We merely have to suspend our disbelief a little more than we would in the book.<br /><br />Speaking of suspending our disbelief, I cannot reiterate enough that Dan Brown wrote a fictional book.  He wrote a story to entertain, not to teach or challenge the church.  With that in mind, I can't believe how much controversy there has been surrounding this film.  Many religious groups have called for this film to be banned, stating that its subject matter is blasphemous.  Some countries succeeded in getting it banned, while many people in the United States are actively protesting.  Just look at some of the reviews on this site.  It is obvious that the writers haven't seen the film, but they disagree with the secret (which, unfortunately, a few of them reveal, so if you don't want to be spoiled, be very careful when picking which reviews to read).  It's too bad that so many people are so close-minded and cannot understand what fiction means.  The DaVinci Code is a great story that everyone should definitely read, and most people should see (I can understand how some fans of the book would be put off by the film).  Ron Howard and company have given us a good movie with a cool plot, solid acting, and good effects.  Don't let a little controversy stand in your way of seeing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"The DaVinci Code" was only recently purchased by me.  I've read the book & seen the theatrical release.  Hanz Zimmer's score was nominated for a Golden Globe award.  Ron Howard won his Best Director Oscar for "A Beautiful Mind" in 2001.  I thought he did an excellent job of keeping the pacing moving and the unexpected plot turns popping up with regularity.  I greatly appreciated the look of the film and the stunning locations.<br /><br />The most amazing performance in the film for me is Paul Bettany as Silas.  The intensity and level of commitment he brings to the role is breathtaking.  As the cold-blooded killer who breaks the ten commandments as a service to God and flagellates himself as punishment, Bettany takes the performance over the top.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou charmed me in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640VO">Amelie</a> for which she received a Best Actress nomination from the French Academy of Cinema in 2001.  She demonstrates range from that film to this by playing Sophie Neveu with a tightly controlled performance.<br /><br />Tom Hanks won back-to-back Oscars in 1993 & 1994 for "Philadelphia" & "Forrest Gump" and was nominated for "Saving Private Ryan" in 1998 and for "Cast Away" in 2000.  As Robert Langdon, he gives a thoughtful performance, playing a character who is cerebral.  Howard gives him quite a bit of screen time as we watch him think.  It's interesting, but short of gripping.<br /><br />Ian McKellan was twice Oscar-nominated for Best Actor for "Gods & Monsters" in 1998 and in the supporting role in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" in 2001.  As Sir Leigh Teabring, he almost makes me forget X-men with a strong performance as the wealthy man who enjoys pulling the strings.<br /><br />Other performances are also of note.  Alfred Molina from "Chocolat" in 2000 and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002C9D9U">Luther</a> in 2003 plays Bishop Aringarosa who comes across as a heavy (pun intended) fanatic who is willing to break commandments for religious political expediency.  Jurgen Prochnow from "Das Boot" (1981), "The English Patient" (1996), & "Air Force One" (1997) performs well as the bank manager Vernet who also wants to own the secrets in Neveu's account.  Jean Reno who I loved in the 1994 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767802519">The Professional</a> and enjoyed in "The Pink Panther (2006) plays Captain Bezu Fache, the police chief who works to solve the crime.  Jean-Yves Borteloot plays Teabring's chauffeur Remy Jean and is given a free reign by Ron Howard to excellent result.  Marie-Francoise Audollent does a nice cameo as Sister Sandrine who runs into Brother Silas.<br /><br />Dan Brown's book has of course created controversy, particularly from those unable to distinguish fiction from real life or those whose weak faith results in defensiveness about their religion.  The magnificent teachings and life of Jesus of Nazareth cannot be threatened by this fictional film anymore than the Taj Mahal could be threatened by a fly.  As a film, this works well, entertaining with repeated viewings.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>The movie started fairly strong .. decent action and story-line . Strong story line.. be prepared to pay attention... if your into simple storyline.. skip this movie .. you just wont get the concept.... so for that I give 4</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I must say, I was completely blown away by this movie!  Directed by Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind helmer Ron Howard, The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating, complex tale that begins with the murder of Jacques Sauniere, a curator at the Musee du Louvre in Paris, while Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is speaking at a conference on symbology.  When Langdon is contacted by French police and taken to the Louvre, ostensibly to help the police with the case, that's where the fun begins!<br /><br />The story in The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced one, but not so much so that the average viewer is left completely confused.  Written by A Beautiful Mind scribe Akiva Goldsman, the script tightens up the plot enough that it can be fitted into a 2 1/2 hour movie without leaving a person wondering if he's missed something.  I must admit, Mr. Goldsman has come a long way from Batman Forever!<br /><br />The choices in casting for this movie were very good as well.  Tom Hanks plays Langdon with a laconic, dry wit that reminds me somewhat of British historian Simon Schama, and Audrey Tautou is exquisite as Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of Sauniere who harbors a very special secret, one unknown even to her.  Paul Bettany is engaging, yet frightening as the albino monk Silas, and Jean Reno excels in his role as Bezu Fache, the French cop who thinks that Langdon is the killer.  Lastly, there's the wonderfully diabolical Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa, the Opus Dei priest who appears to be controlling the puppet strings at first, but who is being manipulated by a mysterious voice over the phone called the Teacher.<br /><br />Most of the arguments I've seen against The Da Vinci Code center around its presentation of historical myths such as the Priory of Sion and Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus as "fact".  With all respect to those who might use this as an excuse to trash The Da Vinci Code, let me say again what has already been repeated on here more than a dozen times: IT'S JUST A MOVIE.  I myself have seen several documentaries and read a not inconsiderable amount of literature that completely debunks the Priory of Sion and the presentation of Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife and mother of the Merovingian line, yet I enjoy The Da Vinci Code because IT'S JUST A MOVIE.  No mystery there.<br /><br />When all is said and done, I heartily recommend The Da Vinci Code.  It's a film with enough twists and plots to keep you guessing until the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Didn't read the book, however I enjoyed watching this movie!

I enjoyed the movie better than I thought I would based on the critical panning it took. However, it didn't add much if anything to what I got from the book. I thought that the considerable talents of Audrey Tatou were largely wasted as Sophie. Tom Hanks was OK as Langdon. Ian McKellen was a hoot as Teabing. All-in-all, an earnest adaptation, but nothing special--many film versions of very popular books have turned out the same way, and some films have been quite a bit worse (Bonfire of the Vanities, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, for example), so I guess that DaVinci Code was handled pretty well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>This film is nothing to write home about, I'm glad I didn't go to the movies to see it but it was enjoyable enough to watch on DVD.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was a passable Robert Langdon, a bit wooden but okay, Audrey Tautou was a lot better as Agent Sophie Neveu, she gave a good rendition of fragility and strength in her role as the young woman whose own past is shrouded in secrecy, Paul Bettany was great as the haunted violent Monk Silas, and we had a cracking cameo appearance in Jurgen Prochnow as the corrupt bank official, along with Alfred Molina as the hard line voice of the Catholic Church and Opus Dei official.<br /><br />For me though the best two actors in the whole film were Jean Reno as the dogged French police officer who at first is convinced that Robert Langdon is guilty of murder but soon realises he is being played for a fool by the church and Ian McKellan as the monstrous Sir Leigh Teabing who has more secrets inside of him than Opus Dei itself.<br /><br />The movie doesn't follow Dan Brown's book exactly but what movie does?<br /><br />There are some good special effects, lots of spooky moments, eerie music and a mad dash around the world by Dr Langdon and Sophie as they work toward unravelling the greatest secret of Christendom, did Mary Magdalene actually marry Jesus Christ and did they have children whose descendents might still be living in the 21st century?<br /><br />There are the usual twists and turns, a sting in the tail so to speak and lots of clues, and codes to decipher.<br /><br />Not too gratuitously violent but it does have its moments and worth watching if you like a good old fashioned pot boiler of a thriller that was made on a mega budget.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I found myself caught up in the story of this film.  I'm not sure if I buy the whole Jesus bloodline thing, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of this well made film.  Tom Hanks does his usual good job, and is supported by a fine cast of players.  The film is layered nicely as one clue leads to another with a twist and turn here and there to keep you guessing.  The religious implications aside, this is a good movie that makes you think.  After seeing the film, I would say to go pick up the book which expands greatly on the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I really really liked this a lot.  Was it worth all the hype that surrounded it?  I don't think so, but it's as good as the book.<br /><br />When I go and see a movie, I don't go to completely analyse it.  I go to enjoy it and be entertained and enjoy the escapism that comes from the magic of movies.  I didn't sit there analysing this to the death, I just sat back and enjoyed.<br /><br />I think Ron Howard et al did a good job with it and I think all the actors did a great job in portraying their individual characters.  If you have read the book, you will find it to be just as you imagined it would.  I didn't find many differences in it and things happened just as I remembered.<br /><br />With the beautiful settings and the gripping story lines, this is a movie you'll love.  Don't read too much into it - take it for what it is; pure enjoyment and entertainment.  Go see this, you will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I went into this movie with low expectations because of all the negative reviews it has received.  I was amused at the different reactions at the end of the film.  The annoying guy on my left shouted "wonderful!" and the guy on my right said: "What an awful movie!"<br /><br />In the end, I was diverted for the time I was there, but the negative reviews are right.  1)  The movie is LONG!  This is ironic because the novel was a fast read.  The pacing is just off.  There is too much backstory that they try to jam in.  2)  There are needless changes to the plot of the book.  The effect is that it makes a silly story even sillier.  3)  One-dimensional characters.  Robert Langdon is a cipher in the book and a cipher in the movie.  (Also, Tom Hanks' voice sounds odd.)  The only characters I cared about were Silas and Leigh Teibing.  4)  There is an overall lack of suspense and excitement.<br /><br />Now, for people unfamiliar with the book, there might be the element of surprise.  Also, the film plays as a wonderful travelogue for London and Paris.  The cities look great.  If this film makes people want to read and travel more, that is a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>WARNING! if you never read the book or have seen documentaries about it and don't really know what its about then you'll be confuse maybe a little and bored like my husband was..It was interesting to me and a little drawn out in some areas of the film honestly i expected a little more action most of the time but it was more about explaining things...I think reviews on this movie will get more 1 & 2 stars because there was so much hype around it  that after you finally see it your not going to feel as excited as you felt going in...<br /><br />The other subject about this is that some reviewers are saying if your a christian or catholic not to see it it lies about Jesus and other stuff even though they know its a fiction, but honestly it tries to prove and show more about Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church.<br /><br />My faith is strong enough to see this film and will not change because of the questions being brought up even though its fiction because some people read way too much into it its more looked as what if to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>This movie has one of the best thought out and tightest plots I have ever seen.

This is not one of those films that you can pop into the DVD player and watch while your mind is elsewhere; this is a movie that needs to be viewed with articulate attention. I was halfway through the movie before I knew what it was actually about. I have talked to others who have said that reading the book before viewing  the film helps the viewer in understanding the characters and story so I would advised that first. But if you haven't got access to the book here is what I surmised from the viewing of the movie: the main story focuses on the allegation that Jesus Christ actually fatherd a child and had a girl named Sarah. Sarah's  blood line exists to this day much to the chagrin of the Catholic Church. The movie dramitizes certain members who are Roman Catholic determined not to have this knowledge of that bloodline become known. Leonardo Da Vinci's portrait of the last supper has clues and hints of this new knowledge of Christ and that is major plot of the film and alas the "Da Vinci Code" comes from this. The film became one of the biggest blockbusters in motion picture history while at the same time becoming very controversial with conservative Catholics. At nearly two and half hours long the movie makes the viewer think if these allegations of Christ are true. The film is extremely well-acted by Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast and Ron Howard did a virtuoso job as director filming the movie entirely in Europe. The "Da Vinci Code" would spawn the sequel "Angels and Demons" that also became a hit. This 2 disc DVD features bonuses including interviews with Hanks and Howard, behind the scenes clips, and much more. Ebert and Roeper give the film "Two thumbs Up".</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Anybody who has read the book knows that Tom Hanks is NOT in no way Robert Langdon. No. Way. When I first heard that I thought it was a joke, but unfortunetly, it was the awful truth. And he did ruin the movie for me. That and the fact that they butchered the beautiful novel. It was barely recognizable. What's even worse is that they are making 'Angels and Demons' and still keeping Tom Hanks. Another disaster waiting to happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>After all the hoopla and controversy parting the waters between the religious right and Catholic Church and the avid devotees of Dan Brown's multi-million dollar success book, the movie version is finally here.  THE DA VINCI CODE makes a  good movie - and that is enough.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard has assembled a good international cast, trusted the screenplay to Akiva Goldsman, and in fine Hollywood style has transformed an interesting premise of a story from Dan Brown's interested though unsophisticatedly written blockbuster into a suspense thriller.  The story of a murder in the Louvre leading a former flatfoot detective turned writer of symbology and a French cryptographer on a chase involving the Vatican, the Opus Dei society, and the Priory guarding the Holy Grail is full of terrific visualizations of some of the encrypted secrets of Brown's novel and in the end the movie allows the viewer to follow the interesting story much more easily than did the book.<br /><br />The settings are magnificent (cinematography by Salvatore Totino), the musical score by Hans Zimmer sweeps the story along embracing all aspects of the atmosphere, and the visual effects department has done a fine job with some tough tasks.  The actors take their characters in stride, given that many of them are over the top figures: Ian McKellen will satisfy every reader's vision of Sir Leigh Teabing; Paul Bettany is appropriately crazy as Silas; Jean Reno offers a Captain Fache who manages to hold things together; Audrey Tatou turns a fine spin as the all-important Sophie Neveu; and Tom Hanks sleepwalks through his rather innocuous conception of Robert Langdon.  And the ending is a rather sappy sellout not found in the book - but this is Hollywood...<br /><br />This film may set box office records - which seems to be the point in making it - and serves to prove what good PR work can do for a movie.  Many will put down 'The Da Vinci Code' because of religious reasons or other reasons, but in the end it is a just a good story well told - not a great movie but an entertaining one.  Recommendation: a good 2 1/2 hour diversion, but not one to rush out to see until the crowds dwindle a bit. Grady Harp, May 06</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>I liked the "DaVinci Code", and considered its premise intriguing.  I didn't rush out and debate it at the water cooler, didn't consult my priest, didn't go crazy and buy everything Dan Brown had written (most of it workmanlike, but not noteworthy!).  I reread it a couple of weeks ago to refamiliarize myself for the movie, and liked it a little better.  I think Dan Brown wrote it with the screen in mind.<br /><br />The controversy around the world based on first the book and then the movie amuses me.  Brown raises some age-old religious fables which have an element of believable truth in them.  If you are a Christian, and especially if you are Catholic, you should be more concerned about the political machinations for hundreds of years of a faith trying to cover up its less than savory origins, and not so much about all the details of how Jesus lived.  And no matter who you are, please keep in mind, THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.<br /><br />So I decided to put to the side all the controversy over the film in the review and simply focus on the film itself.  I would have liked the film's director to do that as well, and to make the film as art, without regard to worldwide events.  But,<br /><br />as usual, Ron Howard avoided controversy.  Like in the film, "A Beautiful Mind" where he avoided the homosexuality and abusiveness of his main character, and in "Cinderella Man" where he avoided the corruption in the fight industry, Howard plays to the mainstream.<br /><br />The DaVinci Code deserved another director.  For one thing, without Howard, there would probably have been no Tom Hanks.  Hanks can be an actor without peer (Philadelphia), but the hero of this book had to be passionate about his belief in the finding of the Holy Grail, and torn in his decision on whether to reveal it.  Hanks is of an age and of a look where he needs to step up to the roles of older men.<br /><br />Writer Akiva Goldman chose in the script to write Langdon as a skeptic, and Hanks conveyed it, without managing to generate any heat for Sophie's (Audrey Tautou) character.  Who better - Hugh Jackman?  Sean Penn?  Adrien Brody?  Nicholas Cage?  Certainly I would have rather seen Langdon played with the quirky characteristics that a "symbologist" must have, given their careers.<br /><br />I felt the rest of the cast played true, especially Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teague.  McKellan sparkled, and the film came alive for awhile when he first came on the screen.  The problem is the blending of the cast, eliciting both individually great performances and ensemble mentality; Howard failed here, and the results make the audience restless.  He has done this fine blending once or twice in the past, but he is usually more concerned about the visual quality of the film (DaVinci was stunning) and the concepts...whether to use flashback and CSI (both are quietly stunning in this film) and steering clear of controversy. It's a shame, when he always manages to put a cast of fine actors together.<br /><br />My main complaint is that DaVinci should have been a thriller.  Maybe it is difficult to brink an important contemporary novel to the screen and elicit the pace and the emotion that makes a good thriller.  Somebody better tell Clint Eastwood that...his "Mystic River" was far superior to Howard's effort here, and he would have been a better choice to direct.<br /><br />The film was visually stunning and the content adequate.  Nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code as a novel is an international bestselling phenomenon, but The Da Vinci Code as a movie is bound to be long forgotten by year's end. Directed by Ron Howard, the Hollywood veteran behind such memorable films as A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, this adaptation of Dan Brown's religious thriller is 149 minutes of monotonous exposition and tedious European spy thriller clich&eacute;s. What makes Dan Brown's novels so popular is the narrative background on such subjects as cryptography, secret societies, religious orders, and alternative history. But it's difficult to translate such ideas to the big screen, and it's here that The Da Vinci Code fails as a commercial thriller. Entire scenes are composed of lectures on the history of Christianity and the life of Leonardo Da Vinci. Michael Crichton has a similar style of writing that focuses on scientific breakthroughs and cutting-edge technology, but his novels adapt better to the big screen. Whereas Jurassic Park briefly lectured audiences on the inner-workings of DNA, then quickly jumped to two hours of dinosaurs terrorizing people, The Da Vinci Code keeps explaining, hypothesizing, and lecturing only to leave its audience hanging. The ideas are intriguing, but they make for a far better novel than silver screen blockbuster. Minus the interesting conjecture, the film is nothing more than a poorly written 1970s drugstore spy thriller...<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays the lead role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of religious symbology lecturing in Paris. When Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), curator of the Louvre, is found murdered and strangely positioned in his famous museum, local authorities initially consult Langdon for his expertise. But the professor soon learns from Sauniere's granddaughter, government cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), that he and the prime suspect are one and the same. Creating a diversion for the police, the two discover a hidden trail of clues created by Sauniere in the moments before his death, clues that just might lead them to most elusive treasure in human history - the Holy Grail. With InterPol hot on their trail, and the true murderer still at large, Langdon and Neveu enlist the help of Grail historian Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) to teach them the history of the Grail's protectors, The Priory of Scion, and to help them uncover the endless clues that promise to unravel a 2,000 year mystery...<br /><br />Despite the remarks of most critics, Tom Hanks' performance is not atrocious. Although his character is bland at best, he wasn't given much with which to work. Robert Langdon's lack of development is more attributable to poorly written dialogue and poor choices in direction. Ron Howard tries to cover up some of the excessive dialogue with visual images, but narrative is still narrative even with flashback sequences. Audrey Tautou delivers her lines well, but suffers from the same constraints as her Academy Award-winning screen partner. The only shining performance is provided by Ian McKellen as the eccentric and charming Grail expert, Leigh Teabing. Some of his one-liners add a bit of comic relief, but they're only band-aids on the gushing head wound that is this film. In the end, The Da Vinci Code is a lesson on the distinction between two differing mediums. Movies haven't replaced books, or vice-versa, for a reason. Sometimes, it's just better to read the book. In the case of The Da Vinci Code, this is one of those moments...<br /><br />Britt's Rating: 7.2/10<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>Do you know what one of the greatest secrets in human history is? No it's not the story of Jesus. It's how the Hollywood movie industry can sell you a long boring movie that is like watching paint dry, by hyping it up and spending the bucks on mass advertising. Obviously a lot of people out there are easily entertained by some really dull, bromidic, platitudinous material. I mean, why not just stay home and read your dumb book you keep comparing and contrasting it to? I go to movies to be entertained, not fall asleep! After I seen the movie, I said "so what? Who cares?" The answer to that question is church members with their picket signs who have nothing better to do. Their signs say things like "this movie is blasphemous" and "don't see this movie, it is sacrilegious". I think these groups of people soon forget that more people have died in the name of religion than all of the wars in history put together. To add to that same note, the Catholics think their religion is so perfect, yet they seem to forget the hundreds and thousands of innocent women who were tortured and killed in the 14th century because they were deemed to be witches. PLEASE! Put your picket signs away and go back to church! Just seeing them made me wish I liked this movie more, but I didn't.<br /><br />Verdict: it is vapid, and you cannot get a refund on those two and a half hours you spent watching it. I compare it to spending a long amount of time in a hospital waiting room! Although, I look forward to seeing the protestors at the new release of the 'Omen'movie. Just the fact that the movie is being released on 6/6/06. That should get them excited!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Hollywood has always held a special place in its collective heart for movies that trample upon religion, specifically Christianity.  I am unsure as to why this is, though I have my theories, but irregardless of how offensive the subject matter of some religious thrillers may be to certain groups, Hollywood can't help but release more and more semi-blasphemous or full-out blasphemous material.  Now, as a Christian I can still watch these movies, viewing them for what they are, fiction, plus my faith is strong enough to not be shaken by any work of fiction.  So, when I heard that Ron Howard (director of "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind") would be directing an adaptation of Dan Brown's best-selling novel "The Da Vinci Code" and the film would star Tom Hanks ("Castaway" and "Forrest Gump"), I was intrigued since I am a fan of both the director and the star.  I had heard about the controversy surrounding this movie and the novel that inspired it, but I had heard from other movie-goers that this adaptation steered away from the more blasphemous material from the novel, and presented a more balanced view of the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdelene and may have sired a child (again this is a theory, and one I do not believe is true in any way).  I have to admit that even though I heard this movie would possibly be blasphemous, I wanted to watch it and see for myself, plus in truth, I have been a fan of numerous movies that weren't exactly faithful in their depictions of Christianity or Catholicism, I was able to view them as works of fiction and enjoy them; examples would be "End of Days" and "Constantine".  The question is however, can I do it for this movie, knowing that the intention of the author, Dan Brown, was to try to disrupt people's faith in God by presenting this theory that is not even remotely supported by any real evidence, merely a painting done by Leonardo Da Vinci serves as the only basis for the theory.<br /><br />"The Da Vinci Code" follows a Harvard Professor of Symbology named Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who has been summoned to the Louvre to decode a bizarre series of clues at a murder scene.  When Langdon arrives he is warned that he is the primary suspect in the murder, and is then aided by a Cryptologist named Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).  With French police tracking their every movements, Robert and Audrey are trying desperately to survive and still unravel the ever-expanding mystery surrounding the murder.  A mystery that involves a secret from the time of Jesus, that if proven true could shatter the very faith of Christianity.<br /><br />For some reason, even though this was a high-profile movie for Hollywood due to its subject matter, critics blasted the movie, as basically being too self-important, poorly acted and executed, and just completely boring.  This came as a shock to me, because critics love movies that blast religion, and the religious thrillers that critics hate, I generally love because that means they're not as one sided as the critics had hoped.  So with that thought, I was even more excited to see "The Da Vinci Code", and see what all of the fuss was about.  Well, I have to say that I have to agree with the critics on this movie, not completely, but mostly.<br /><br />I felt the movie tried to hard to be such an 'important' movie, especially in the last half hour, that it really brings the movie to a screeching halt.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 hours of "The Da Vinci Code", but once the murder/mystery aspect of the movie was wrapped up, which by the way would have been a perfect stopping point and would have provided a much stronger movie, but the last half hour completely ruined the movie experience for me.  Over the course of the first 2 hours the theory of Christ having a wife was presented, but evidence refuting the theory was also presented, both sides getting equal share, which was interesting to watch, but in the last half hour only the theory is given screen time and the movie veers heavily into the blasphemy arena.  As far as the actors performances were concerned, I thought that both lead actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, did excellent jobs in their respective roles.  The true star of the movie was Sir Ian McKellan's character, which most critics agree with me on that statement, he was really enjoying his role in the movie, and the scenes with him and Tom Hanks arguing back and forth over the validity of the theory were a joy to witness.  I felt the directing was solid, which is no surprise since Ron Howard was at the helm, and from what I hear, it was his decision to tone down the more blasphemous parts from the novel and present a more balanced perspective.  The way Ron Howard chose to portray Robert's ability to decipher code was interesting, yet very reminiscient of the way Russell Crowe's character understood numbers in Ron's earlier work "A Beautiful Mind", which made me kind of let down that he wasn't more original and chose to copy himself.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the majority of this movie, the last half hour was especially weak and ruined the movie for me.  I do believe the movie is worth watching once, especially the entertaining first 2 hours, but after the movie wrapped with the dismally boring final 30 minutes, I did feel as if I had wasted my time, and would have enjoyed it much more if the movie would have ended with the conclusion of the murder mystery.<br /><br />"The Da Vinci Code" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>(with the exception of McKellen as Teabing - maybe cuz that is not how I imagined him when I saw the book "play" in my head while reading it).<br />Hanks also kinda eeee. Not really inspired.<br />As for movie itself - flashbacks into history nicely incorporated, action in present so much slower than the book, the real reason for enstrangement between Sauniere and Sophie not REALLY explained (while crucial to the story of the sacred feminine), meaning of Sophie's name not explained (also important for the whole premise of the book).<br />Too long in length, too little content, too lil action (compared to book).<br />When the movie played in your head while reading the book outshines the Hollywood production, result is disappoinment. So with this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The Davinci Code, 2006 film<br /><br />The story begins with a man running down a corridor that has paintings on the wall. Another man follows him to threaten him into revealing a secret. Elsewhere a man speaks about symbols. The police ask him to look at a picture of a man. Elsewhere that killer makes his report. You know he is weird when he punishes himself. Robert Langdon visits a glass pyramid in Paris to talk about the victim. A telephone message tells him he is in great danger. A visitor goes to Saint-Sulpice. Someone placed a "tracking dot" on Langdon."Who are you?" Langdon escapes, but is tracked. Or is he? That Fibonacci code was scrambled. An anagram? What is the "Priory of Sion"? There is a car chase to wake up the viewer. [Are you confused by the plot?] Silas searches for an item. Is it connected to the "Holy Grail"? [Is this a weird movie so far?]<br /><br />The bishop holds a secret meeting. Elsewhere Sophie talks about family history. There is another strange event, then a man with a gun. Sophie and Robert go to visit Lee, an Englishman who lives in France. Silas learns of their destination. The Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth - the Holy Grail. [How honest is that history of Constantine?] Interpreting the facts to support a point of view? Can an old painting really tell the facts? Or another example of seeing what you want to see? [No wonder people objected to this movie.] That "Malleus Maleficarum" was used for witch-hunting in Renaissance times. The TV news shows Sophie and Robert as murderers on a killing spree. A small box contains a cylinder with rotating wheels, like an old-time coding device. There is a surprising attack! The police are outside and soon enter. But Sophie and Robert escape in a car with Lee.<br /><br />"Opus Dei" is a conservative group that works for the Vatican. Is there another group that kills its imagined enemies? Fache learns of their air flight plan. A "Messenger of God"? [Isn't that like saying King Herod was doing God's work?] Elsewhere men talk about destroying a sarcophagus. What about an heir (or heiress)? A sacrifice for the betterment of humanity? Robert finds an engraved metal disk in that wooden box, another clue. They are making history now. Switzerland does not allow extradition. Fache is Opus Dei, his bishop games him orders. Breaking his vow? Will the police intercept them in London? "Start with him." Scotland Yard is prepared to shoot. "The French can't be trusted." Will the police follow their car? There is a surprise in the Templar Church in London. Can they escape?<br /><br />There is another surprise in the car. Will Silas be blessed? Will the other man get his reward? Who was Alexander Pope? There are marks in the dust. [Does this contradict the cleanliness of this building?] Lee shows up and "knows too much". There is a shooting at that Opus Dei house. "We are betrayed." They use a cell phone to trace its calls. Is Sophie the guardian of the grail? "Open the cryptex!" There is another surprise before the police arrive. Does Lee's talk sound crazy? They visit an old church. "Where did she go?" Men arrive. Sophie tells about her past. Another riddle solved. Is Sophie descended from the Merovingian Kings? Royal blood? [Isn't this all just too fantastic?] Can you believe the ending? Robert gets a clue from a book. Its too fantastic for words.<br />This movie reminds me of "The 39 Steps" for its chases, and "The Maltese Falcon" for its search for a treasure that isn't there. There are some interesting scenes but this is a worthless story.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>It just barely manages to stay afloat as an action packed thriller, and you've got to ask yourself, just where did all the mega-millions poured into this film go? Besides it's promotion, that is. Like it's art history subject matter, I expected a cinematic canvas of depth and beauty, but this is more like standard action fare, as Ron Howard's generic and hurried direction rushes by like he's filming NASCAR and throwing a rude mustache on the Mona Lisa. It breathes like a lesser James Bond film, with lots of facial concentrations, typical car crash and shoot 'em up violence, and so much conversation, at times they may as well be reading aloud from the book. Unlike the book, (I suppose), it is more indebted to the action genre than it is art history, even the spliced flashback images of ancient times seems more an homage to Cecil B. DeMille, than it is true history. Tom Hanks never quite grips the role of an ancient symbols expert thrown into a diabolical plot, his security and knowledge of the subject matter is aloof and increasingly dissipates as the film progresses, like you expect him to moronically and unknowingly burst, "Hey, this is some heavy stuff!", at any moment. Audrey Tatou's role as a student of cryptic analysis, is reduced to what seems a dull investigative reporter, full of routine questions, and duly surprised reaction that only serve as springboards for the film to delve into a facts and legends expose. Picture a big budget History Channel on Halloween night. There's also a grueling sort of half-hearted glibness at mention of what seems controversial subjects; The Pope, Catholics, a blood line French family, as if the film smugly retains a secret it yet shares with its audience, and a ridiculously indulgent line uttered by Hanks at the height of action; "I've got to get to a library!", that suggests to the audience to look it up themselves if the film falls short of total explanation. I'm googling Rosalind as I speak.  The Da Vinci Code is an amazingly conventional and second rate thriller. But is it art?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's "The Da Vinci Code" is a workmanlike, well made film about an unusual and extraordinary subject that deserves a more interesting, better realized screen presentation than Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman provide.<br />Let's face it: the theory that Christ married Mary Magdalene and had children is rife with controversy on many levels. Personally, I could care less if Christ married and had children but I can also understand that this theory would drive groups like Opus Dei over the edge as this would make Christ less a deity and more a human being which would, on the positive side make Him more accessible to the 21st. century than does the porcelain statue planted in your local church.<br />The basic plot of "TDC" is like a treasure hunt and though it is way too long by 20 minutes, there are genuine stretches of time when this film is absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately there are also stretches that are simply boring.<br />Tom Hanks and particularly Audrey Tautou do a very good job of being tour guides through all the dogma, theory, superstition, facts and fiction of this film and its many divergent plot strains and ultimately they succeed in making the film interesting. But what this film really needs is a bona fide task master with a definite, concrete take and a subjective point of view like Robert Altman or Roman Polanski to judiciously edit this subject matter into a more cohesive whole. Ron Howard's downfall is that he tries to make a balanced, objective film and all this accomplishes is a film devoid of personality or pizazz: he tries to be all things to all people and ends up being nothing to anyone.<br />As it is "The Da Vinci Code" is a good movie highlighted by two good central performances and an interesting premise that never really catches fire.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>This wasn't a horrible movie, but there was something missing. Most people had read the book, so it was from the beginning a difficult challenge for the movie to do more than the book. I don't think it did. At least the soundtrack is awesome. (Hans Zimmer-highly recommended).</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Harvard professor Robert Langdon was dragged into a religious conflict that dated back a few millenniums. He and French Cryptographer Sophie Neveu had work together to follow the path toward the answers. Conflicts arose from many sources: the figurative path to follow was not known, neither were the questions whose answers are sought, and Robert Langdon was wanted for murder. In a surprising turn of events, the path begano reveal itself in religious lore and a few of Leonardo Da Vinci's works.<br /><br />I cannot say how enjoyable the movie would be to someone who has not read the book, or at least read it recently. I had just finished reading the book about two weeks before I saw the movie at the theater. Many things were different. In my opinion, too many things were different. There were so many intricate details pieced together in the book that had to be removed for the sake of time that left enormous holes. Some of the holes were patched with movie-specific details, but they were not as good.<br /><br />I believe that, for the most part, people prefer whichever came first, reading the book or seeing the movie. It becomes a reference point against which the other is measured and many differences seem too great to overcome. Having read the book first, I cannot tell you if the book is worth reading after seeing the movie. I can tell you, however, the movie was not worth seeing after reading the book.<br /><br />A friend of mine made a fantastic point that summed up the difference between the two mediums perfectly. He said, "The book was much more Indiana Jones than the movie." On paper, the story had much more mystery and suspense. Almost none of it translated onto the big screen.<br /><br />He and I differed in our opinions of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. I cannot speak for his reasons, but he thought Hanks was good for the part. I thought it was a poor casting choice. Additionally, he sounded like he did back in the 80s; the sound is as if hearing his own voice delivering the words is a surprise to him. (Think about it.)<br /><br />The dialogue in the movie was horribly forced. It was a long string of forced cues. To be able to explain what was happening, without the luxury to include a chapter of text, writers built all-too-convenient verbal cues. One character, seemingly out of the blue, would ask another something completely unrelated to the current conversation and then the second person would feign surprise and explain how it all ties together. Compare this exactly to when you try to coerce another person to answer a question to which you already know the answer. (I don't think I explained that very well, but it was the best I can do.)<br /><br />If you have read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, especially recently, I do not recommend you see the movie.

They've take one of the dumbest books ever written and turned it into an even dumber film. I loathed the book but expected to enjoy the film, and for precisely the same reason: what Brown had written was not a novel but essentially a 400-page treatment for a Hollywood movie. But even with such promising raw material Howard and Goldsman have managed to screw it up. The fundamental problem here is one of tone. Rather than embracing the radiant absurdity of Dan Brown's storytelling, the entire film is suffused with a turgid tone of reverential self-importance. It's gloomy, heavy, dull; tediously solemn, laborious and cold. What it needed was the magic of a director like Spielberg who showed, with the "Raiders" trilogy, that you can deftly blend action, mystery and humour into a rollicking good time without losing any of the spine-tingling religiosity at the heart of this kind of story. But in Howard's hands, it tanks. Stripped of Brown's 100-odd chapter structure which almost guarantees a cliffhanger on every second page, the story drags. And nothing in Howard's style compensates. The camera work is lazy, the editing dull, the staging dark and uninteresting. Even the master of overblown melodrama, Hans Zimmer, sounds bored. The performances are similarly lackluster. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou look constantly nervous - perhaps worried that Hanks' botox won't last the shoot. There's no chemistry between them, and not a single scene which would have allowed any to develop. Paul Bettany as Silas is less creepy than he is sad. Alfred Molina and Jean Reno are wasted in minor roles. Only Ian McKellen, as Sir Leigh Teabing the conniving cripple, manages to hit the note of inspired lunacy which, if grasped by Howard, might have made this an immensely enjoyable night out. As it stands, it ends up being amusing for all the wrong reasons - never more so than when it tries to hedge its bets with the Religious Right by having Langdon wonder aloud why Jesus couldn't have been a father as well as the Son of God. As if thinking Christians everywhere haven't been wondering that for centuries.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>I can't complain about the pace of this thriller. It does move quite fast from start to finish considering everything. I would say that going to see it is not such a waste of your precious time if you understand that it is going to be pure popcorn fodder and nothing more. It is however highly blasphemous and Christians will be appalled at how dangerous this material is for the gullible (For example the history of the Templar Knights is absolutely fantasy and there are 12 apostles in the Last Supper painting, not 12 + 1). There are reviewers here who even believe that this film is a tutorial of facts. It is not the film itself that is dangerous but the people watching it. The ignorance for the historical record is unforgivable. However, Ultra feminists will love this movie. Apart from that there are some great moments but important characters are wasted and plot holes gap through the screen. It is absolute trash material but somehow I just want to see TOM HANKS in something... anything, but sadly it had to be this. It is a good conspiracy angle and I like the conspiracy undertones and the references to secret societies, with TOM HANKS (who makes it three stars), but it basically ploughs through all morality and standards. I doubt athiests would even discredit Jesus that much! Is this what film is for? The Da Vinci Code ends up playing like Satan is quivering his rear end at you all the way through.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Having the pleasure to finally see the movie soon after reading the book was quite a tasty experience for someone who likes good books and nice movies. Last week I also had the pleasure in purchasing the soundtrack, and upon listening I felt almost trained enough to finally watch the movie, in what I call the preferred order: first I read the book, then listen to the score and then savor the movie.<br /><br />I will have to agree that certain key parts had to be squandered or sped up to fit the 500 page story into a movie that didn't cause an embolism; a blot clot form sitting too long. For that purpose I must say that reading the book filled my nooks and crannies of any doubts and lack of information the movie might have left out, but as I say the movie can stand solid on the ground with its own right, for those who do not wish to read the book.<br /><br />Before I read Da Vinci Code I heard that Tom Hanks will be cast as Robert Langdon, and I must say I was pleased with the choice and pleasantly surprised how a character who plays well in romantic comedies  and war movies pulled out such a human, caring, intelligent and attention absorbing role. Tom was a great Robert Langdon, walking through the pages as I read the book with him in mind, solving world's oldest puzzles, traveling form continent to continent and back to search out in the name of science what he believed in. I think all the main characters such as sweet yet strong Tautou, Reno played Fache right on, Bettany's Silas was haunted yet you couldn't stop looking at him, Aflried Molina as brief as his role, was very good and of course Ian McKellen as Teabing almost stole the whole show! But I must say, that Langdon stood very strongly in front of my eyes on the big screen and  he was transformed through the role into a real scholar, a truth seeker traveling with Sophie at his side, forming a bond of more than friendship; a run for his and her life on a quest to find the Grail. And for those who did not read the book, the movie does a great job of setting up the guilty suspect because there are some bad guys in this movie and half the fun on the trail of the Grail is figuring who they are and what exactly IS the grail. .<br /><br />I thought the movie followed main plot very closely, it even kept the jokes and historical references right on point in order to enrich the experience. I must ad the music, especially when Langdon was in the church finding the code for the cryptex through his memory of the solar system, going through any word that was the answer was insanely gorgeous. The ending song, Kyrie for Magdalene at the very end make all the hair on my body stand straight and left deep satisfaction for coming out and seeing it for myself. I really loved the ending as it was right on and the music was just perfect, rich, romantic, haunting and opulent.<br /><br />Lovely movie, that needs bit of an open mind and as I just read about rights being purchased for part II and III, I am impatiently waiting for any future sightings of Mr. Langdon for where he is hidden trails of adventure loom not too far ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Here we have!. An intriguing and hyper interesting novel converted by the greedy concessions of the market in another cheap thriller where many important details are simply ignored in order to convey and worst still to disorient the great audiences about the relevant dramatic core.<br /><br />Audrey Tatoo did not get the expected chemistry with Tom Hanks and worst still with  the director. Her personage looks extremely flat; she is much better actress than you think in case this is the first time you have watched her on screen.  The only actors who really shone in this stranded mess were Ian Mac Kellen and Jurgen Prochnow.<br /><br />I try to fit the hat of all viewers that did not read the book, and frankly I understand them. There are many holes in the script, that you necessarily must complete reading the book.<br /><br />I really would like to remark ten fundamental inconsistencies I the script; the first one: How did Langdon get to obtain the secret code to open the criptex at the end? (It is too artificial and you may observe it in the book); second, how could the screenwriter to forget the invaluable information about the integrants of Zion's Priorate? it's really unforgiving, third, the sequences in the Ritual I which Sophie saw his grandfather are not enough explained, and that causes a profound distortion on the whole understanding process; four the crucial message around the Virgin of the rocks is simply ignored; five the presence of the watchman at the moment they enter at the temple searching for the graves? ; six: it is not well explained the distorted and brutalizing existence and late conversion of Silas, seven: the final ending in the book suggest us a probably reencounter of Langdon and Sophie, eight: the rivalry between both police officers is not carved in relief; nine there two criptex nor just one; ten what about the enromous significance about the letter V?.<br /><br />In order to adjust certain characters I would have suggested those actors:  Sean Penn,  Tim Roth, Jude Law, Daniel Day Lewis, Robert Downey Jr. or Joseph Fiennes  in the role of Tom Hanks who looked overacted and out of context respect the character of Robert Langdon;  Audrey Tatoo is OK,  and Daniel Auteil as Fache, Gary Oldman or Edward Norton as Silas; Chris Cooper, Tom Wilkinson, Harvey Keitel or Aidan Quinn  as Aringarosa, with a director of more penetrating vision ; four directors come to my mind: Jean Jacques Anaud, Oliver Hirshbiegel, Sam Mendes or Jonathan Demme.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>I must say...

Movies such as this seem to be a great challenge for directors. This story been read by so many and I know the film is almost 2.5 hours long, but this could, and should have been a bit longer or expanded in the correct places. The first 200 pages of Dan Brown's book are adapted into about 20 minutes. All of the anagrams, the Fache (Jean Reno) stuff, investigating the crime scene. ALL of that goes by in an incredibly rushed 20 minutes. You have to give those 20 minutes your full, undivided attention or you'll miss important details. Langdon being Fache's number 1 suspect isn't the least bit surprising. You had just been introduced to both characters 2 minutes beforehand. The film finally decides to slow down and take it's time once we meet Ian Mckellen's character, Leigh Teabing. They should have added at least 30 minutes to the first 20 minutes, and probably put some of those extra minutes into the irksome flashy flashback sequences.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good. Tom Hanks has his weak points in the film, but he's given such little time to react to things, I don't blame him. He gets better as the film goes along. The same can be said about Audrey Tautou. If the film wasn't so swift, I'm sure they'd give great performances. Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Ian Mckellen and Alfred Molina all gave good performance. I'm not surprised that Dan Brown had Jean Reno in mind for Fache when he was writing the book. Ian Mckellen is great as the lovable and humble old man, Teabing. In my opinion, he has the best lines in the film. And Paul Bettany stands out as the albino monk, Silas. I think he gave the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Ron Howard does a good job in the directing chair but if he hadn't rushed and gave more respect to the first 200 pages of Dan Brown's novel I'd probably give this film a higher rating. I do recommend this film but it's better to read it before you see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>After listening to a couple of reviews of "The Da Vinci Code", I wasn't expecting a lot. It has been a long time since I have heard such universally bad word of mouth regarding a film; people laughed and hissed during the screening at Cannes, it received a bad review on a local NPR station, practically every website has lambasted the film. But I went anyway, so I could give you my honest and true opinion.<br /><br />It wasn't that bad.<br /><br />Now, you may be asking yourself. "Wow, thornhill says the movie wasn't that bad. Maybe..." Stop for a moment. Do you really want to spend $8 or $11 on a film that `wasn't that bad'? While "The Da Vinci Code" is not the worst film I have ever seen, it is certainly far from a good film.<br /><br />I have the same problems with the movie that I had with the book. The book is a fun read, a good page turner, but it isn't a great piece of literature. The author does what many authors do nowadays; they write their books to be made into films. As you are reading a chapter, it will suddenly end. A new chapter will pick up with a different character and location, and then it will stop. The next chapter will pick up where the first ended. In other words, he is writing the scenes of the `movie', editing his book much like a film. Also, when movies are made based on books, they generally streamline the dialogue, characters and action. If a book is already written this way, what options do the filmmakers have? Either they add dialogue, character and action or they further streamline it. In the case of "Da Vinci", they further streamlined it, making it less interesting and more movie-like. They have watered down something that was already watered down.<br /><br />Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard, is in Paris to give a lecture. During the lecture, Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre, is murdered by an albino monk (Paul Bettany). Before he dies, the curator leaves a series of clues for Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a police woman who turns out to be Sauniere's granddaughter. The local police chief, Bezo Feche (Jean Reno), immediately suspects Langdon of the murder and chases them through France and England. Along the way, a mysterious Bishop (Alfred Molina) plots to reveal the secret Sauniere, Langdon and Neveu are trying to keep. Along the way, Langdon meets an old friend, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan), who has spent his life trying to decipher the Da Vinci Code. Along the way, they run into members of mysterious branches of the Catholic Church and religious history, including Opus Dei, the Knights Templar and more.<br /><br />Directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, "The Da Vinci Code" is perfectly serviceable at times, but also a bit amateurish and `TV movie of the week-ish" at others.<br /><br />There is zero chemistry between Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou. They only appear to even like each other towards the middle of the film. Until that point, they are thrown together by circumstance and seem merely to tolerate one another, realizing they each have information the other needs. Granted, Tom Hanks is quite a bit older than Audrey Tatou, but you might expect some sort of chemistry to appear, to make them attached to one another by more than circumstance.<br /><br />The supporting cast is generally acceptable. Paul Bettany is the most interesting as a weird Albino monk who believes he must cleanse himself of his sins with self-flagellation. Alfred Molina's Bishop is a bit too mob-like, but interesting as well, providing a caricature of what extremes someone will go to keep a secret. Jean Reno appears bored as the police inspector. Sir Ian McKellan is interesting as the obsessed historian, but his performance contains so much exposition, you lose the train of thought after a while.<br /><br />The main problem with the film is there is so much exposition. In virtually every scene, two or three characters are discussing various aspects of religious symbology. In many, one character will posit a theory and Langdon, Neveu or Teabing will contradict them and explain why they are wrong. This happens over and over again. It reminded me of early sound films. Because the technology was new and big, they couldn't move the microphones very much, for fear of creating static, or making it difficult to hear the actors. The result? In many early sound films, the actors stand together, in front of the camera, talking, much like a stage play. Not exactly the most engrossing method of storytelling. Howard seems to have borrowed this approach. The few, brief action sequences are spread throughout the almost 2 hour 30 minute film, leaving a lot of room for people standing around talking. "The Da Vinci Code" is meant to be part thriller, part mystery. When one of the characters says "I need to get to a library, quick!" you have to wonder how much time they invested in making the film exciting. Worse yet, they don't even go to a library.<br /><br />As Langdon and Neveu hold their various lectures for the other cast members, they frequently stare off into space, thinking of what they are saying. As they do this, they begin to imagine the events as they unfold. Or, these same thoughts help them uncover a long buried secret propelling them to the next mystery. Director Howard uses these moments to bleed images of these events into the frame, in some allowing actors to recreate, in others, panning across images or statues. It is an interesting way of enlarging the action, increasing the scope, but it also reminded me of a History Channel or National Geographic Channel special. I half expected to see people running from an erupting Mount Vesuvius.<br /><br />I think Director Howard was a little out of his league with this film. He does a much better job with dramas and family comedies than he does with "Da Vinci". In an early scene, we track the progress of Sauniere as he runs through the Louvre. Yet, Howard places the camera above him, behind dirty panes of glass and lead work, making it difficult to follow the progress. Ultimately, this robs the scene of any suspense it may have had.<br /><br />I honestly don't understand why so many people are offended by the subject matter of "The Da Vinci Code". Author Dan Brown uses a number of historical events, ideas and bits of legend to craft his tale. It is an interesting theory, but keep in mind the book is published as a piece of fiction. I don't think anyone should assume that Brown is attempting to write a factual representation of history. He has combined various true-life elements, with his own theories and thriller elements to create a readable page-turner.<br /><br />The movie seems very faithful to the book (or my memory of the book, its been a while since I read it) and that's unfortunate. This was a good opportunity for the filmmaker's to improve upon the book, strengthen the action, the dialogue, and the characters, make it a great thriller, to be remembered for the ages.<br /><br />Instead, they created a visual lecture, the perfect companion piece to a book many millions have already read.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Holy Mother of Mary! How do you describe a movie that asks you to "seek the truth" where the "truth" puts one of the foundations of Christianity into question?<br /><br />Well, in a nutshell, I'd describe The Da Vinci Code as a classy whodunit with a religious twist. Tom Hanks again proves to be one of the best actors in Hollywood by bringing Dan Brown's character Robert Langdon to life.<br /><br />Rare is it that a film adaptation of a novel is as good as the book. And The Da Vinci Code re-confirms that axiom. But The Da Vinci Code delivers. It's entertaining. Thought provoking. Controversial. Suspenseful. Thrilling....It has all the main ingredients of the book.<br /><br />2 and a half hours is a bit long, but kudos to Ron Howard and the producers for not editing out key details just for the sake of time. In fact, even at 150 minutes the film adaptation comes up a bit short on explaining the significance of a few of the details that would put the story into a more clear perspective.<br /><br />But overall, it's an enjoyable movie for open minded movie goers. Is it fact or fiction? That's for everyone to decide for themselves. It is indeed a philosophical idiom fielded to the public under the guise of a Whodunit-mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>I never had much interest in either the novel or the book, but I felt some responsibility to see it since it has become such a national phenomenon.  I'm no church historian myself, but I have no argument with the people who claim Dan Brown has misrepresented Christian history.  I also have no quarrel with Brown for playing fast and loose with the facts in the hopes of writing a more provocative and exciting story.  I think Christians can relax; after 2,000 years, including some times of truly horrendous persecution, I think the Christain faith will survive the New York Times bestsellers list.<br /><br />My problem with "Da Vinci Code" is that it is so boring.  I couldn't work up much interest in the constant conspiracy theorizing--it was like watching nine seasons of the "X-Files," without the good parts, condensed into two hours.  We have a few minutes of breathless exposition in one scenic location, jump into a car and race to another location for some more exposition, board a plane and fly somewhere else for still more exposition, and so on.  Director Ron Howard's attempts to liven things up with special effects imaginings of the events described don't quite do the job.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The DaVinci Code begins well enough, though the audience is asked to believe that upon being gutshot a character would use his own blood to leave cryptic clues for his pal Tom Hanks, but quickly gets bogged down in the endless machinations of the plot and ends up collapsing under its own weight--airtight this ain't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>For some reason, when the European monarchs created by Queen Victoria stand side by side, the King of England strongly resembles the last known Czar of Russia who is his brother in law rather than Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd.

After Okinawa was invaded and their king forced to falsely claim that the archipelago nation was long a part of Japan, why did the royal families of South East Asia systematically disappear and what really happened to the true royal family of Corea?  How is it that most of the world's royal families disappeared by the time of World War 2 after the Archduke Ferdinand was probably murdered by his own royal connections because the young Yugoslavian shooter didn't believe that his broken gun actually fired although he was glad that the assassination happened because the Austro-Hungarian/German call it whatever you want - it's the same bad guy - had enslaved the Balkans.

The Rose Line is the line that runs through Beijing aligned to the North Star and Mao Tse Tung has a missing child who was hidden with the Miao aka Hmong ethnic minority tribe during the Long March.  Da Vinci Code is about hiding the sons (AND the daughters) of rulers to prevent forced marriages such as the one to the Austrian Marie Antoinette whose divorce could only be brought about by the French Revolution.  The Scarlet Pimpernel saved aristocrats but not her.  She's the most famous beheading of the French Revolution.  And nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition or St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; why?

Unfortunately, the movie is rather dull and gets bogged down in the details.  Only the part of Sophie Neveu played by Audrey Tautou offers anything of redeeming value.  As has been pointed out by countless others, the movie is of course motivated by an anti-Christian conspiracy, allegations first spawned in the book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ that Mary Magdelene was the wife of Jesus Christ and that together they spawned a bloodline.  This Masonic conspiracy is further boistered up by hidden documents which supposedly revealed the presence of a secret society, the Priory of Sion, which existed to protect the bloodline.  The movie as the book gives way to all sorts of feminist goddess-worshipping nonsense and anti-Christian, anti-Catholic bigotry.  Opus Dei is portrayed as a sinister organization intent on suppressing the "truth" of the holy bloodline, but also easily led astray by Leigh Teabing (a name which is a convenient anagram of the writer of _HB/HG_, Baigent and his partner Leigh), the supposed Grail researcher.  Conveniently Brown never mentions in his book the good done by this organization, how it has led many to God and how it runs shelters for troubled youth, nor the good done by the Catholic church, giving way to every manner of anti-Catholic bigotry so popular in our culture today.  No!  This would all interfere with a good conspiracy story and we could not have that.  Ultimately however the movie fails on several levels.  It is overly long and gets boring in the middle.  Robert Langdon's character played by Tom Hanks comes across as easily confused and prone to claustrophobic fits.  The historical commentary (which there is much of) is almost all uniformly wrong or biased.  And the movie ends up being too much talk and not enough action.  For those of us who did read the book before (and it is nearly impossible not to have given its great proliferation), the movie is ultimately boring because we already know the story all-too-well and the few details which do not coincide with the book itself are rather trivial.  In sum, I believe I am justified in calling this a work of high kitsch which no doubt will enjoy great popularity among the many lost souls craving for something to believe in in this darkened world.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Due to all the hype surrounding this film I had high expectations.

As a book, THE DA VINCI CODE really isn't that great.  The writing is not very tight, the dialogue is rather cheesy, and the characters have about as much personality as cardboard.  The book is far inferior in both style and substance to its predecessor, ANGELS AND DEMONS.  Despite these drawbacks, the book is a mega-bestseller and when a movie adaptation was announced, it had all the signatures to be a major blockbuster:  Ron Howard was signed on to direct, Tom Hanks was signed to star with Ian McKellen signed as part of the supporting cast, and a huge budget (somewhere around $150-$200) to support the project.  The movie was veiled in secrecy and no preview screenings were allowed.  Most of the buzz was that it was going to be the must-see movie of the year.<br /><br />Yet, there was some other noise being made, too.  There were those in the industry who were warning that there was so much secrecy not because of the controversy surrounding the film, but because the movie really wasn't all that great.  The naysayers were right because THE DA VINCI CODE turned out to be nothing more than a lackluster film based on a less than lackluster novel.<br /><br />The film's plot basically follows the plot of the book.  Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a visiting professor of symbology visiting Paris.  An art historian and curator at the Louvre is murdered and Langdon is implicated in the plot.  His awareness of what's going on becomes aroused when a French agent, Sophie Neveu, explains to him that he's the one suspected of murder.  The murdered man turns out to be her grandfather and he left messages that let Sophie know she has to help Langdon.  They team up and begin a cross country midnight adventure that takes them from France to England and back to France again.  Along the way, Langdon and Neveu are joined with the brilliant and handicapped Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) who reveals to Neveu the real cover-up that's going (that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children together).<br /><br />Tom Hanks is normally a brilliant actor whether doing drama or comedy.  However, in THE DA VINCI CODE he seems subdued.  I'm not sure if it's because Langdon isn't much of a character or if Hanks was just doing this movie for the paycheck, though it's probably a combination of the two.  Ron Howard has become a great director, but whatever tricks he's learned making such films as APOLLO 13, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and CINDERELLA MAN were totally thrown out the window with THE DA VINCI CODE because just about anyone who knows how to operate a digital camera could have made the same movie.  The novel really isn't that a great of a book and the movie is even a worse movie.  In fact, the only redeeming thing about the film is Ian McKellen.  McKellen gives a worthwhile performance and is the only person who actually seems to be alive in the movie.  It's kind of bad in a murder-mystery-action picture if the only interesting person in the movie is the old, rich guy who has to have a walker to get around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>I couldn't finish Dan Brown's book: it was just too pedestrian. It reminded me of popular pulp fiction from the 1930's. Yes, it's very clever - clever enough to make him a lot of money. But it is poorly written in a skeletal sort of way - so void of fleshy detail that it reads like a movie script, which probably helped to convince Ron Howard that it would make a good movie. If Howard hadn't made a movie out of it, it probably would have been forgotten in five years or less, the way all fiction of this type is. Now, it could very well be remembered for ten.<br /><br />Mr. Brown has taken history with all its wonderful detail, disassembled and reconstructed it according to a fantastic plan to discount the Church and prove that Christ is not God. By redefining and reinterpreting everything that has happened in the past two thousand years - from events to symbols - Brown attempts to prove that Jesus married Mary Magdaline, and that she, not the chalice from the Last Supper, was the legendary Holy Grail. According to Brown, because they were married and had a child, the Church has spent the past twenty centuries persecuting women and killing off anyone that could prove the humanity of Christ, especially if they were one of his descendants. Thus, the stage is set for a fantastic mystery thriller.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard assembled the best cast and crew, the finest sets and locations, and everything else that money could buy in order to make this film live up to its namesake. He used many of the techniques he perfected in BEAUTIFUL MIND to recreate Brown's eerie tale of cover-up, secret societies, codes, treasure hunts, murder, and all the things that make good pulp fiction entertaining. His film is almost a page-by-page adaptation of Brown's novel. It's uncanny how true he was to it. As far as research and professionalism, Howard actually does his job far better than Brown.<br /><br />Unfortunately - or fortunately - the cast is drab, as are the sets and locations. The story itself gets so bogged down in all the explanations and revelations that, unless the viewer has read the book, he will probably be lost and confused. And when it's all over, the viewer is left with the feeling, "So what?" There is no satisfaction in learning Brown's thesis that Christ was just a man. When you've taken away the hope of the world, what else could you expect? Even from an entertainment standpoint, it is very unsatisfactory. There are a couple of suspenseful moments, but it isn't fun the way a real suspense thriller or murder mystery should be. There are just too many philosophical discussions and not nearly enough adrenaline pounding moments. There's not even a love story.<br /><br />To top it off, to anyone of faith, it's very disturbing. So, any way you look at it, except perhaps financial, the film's a flop - which makes me seriously doubt the rumors that they're planning a sequel. People may have watched the first one to discover what the hubbub was all about, but they won't make that mistake twice.<br /><br />What the book and movie do accomplish - other than making a lot of Christians mad - is to raise the question of how much facts and history can be changed to accommodate a story. After all, we're talking about fiction here. But this is light fiction that is playing with some serious facts and some monumental history; and not just any history: the history of the Church. More importantly, it is fiction that has changed Christ from being God to being just a man - so it's blasphemous fiction to boot. Three centuries ago, both Brown and Howard would have been hung, if not burned at the stake, for their "light fiction."<br /><br />Besides the blasphemy, what bothers me most is the fact that these works lack integrity. They don't respect anything or anyone. They casually misrepresent facts without any attempt at being accurate; but worse, they misrepresent the truth, without any attempt at being honest. Even a fiction writer has to be honest with his research in order to be believable. But this writer and director don't even make a pretense at it. And what's worse, most of their readers and viewers don't seem to care, which shows how far we've come in our own integrity.<br /><br />So, we have a book that is uninspired and pedestrian; a film that is dull and confusing; both of them without integrity, even blasphemous; and neither of them particularly entertaining, except on the most superficial level. Need I say more?<br /><br />Two out of five stars for the book (primarily for cleverness), and three for the film (primarily for production values).<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Sometimes you are constrained by your material.

Thank God. At least there is some Western trash the Chinese audience don't have to endure. Apparently, the movie have also been banned at the Faroe Islands (of all places). Once again: Thank you.<br /><br />Although the movie slightly downplays the most controversial claims in Dan Brown's novel, the basic message is still the same. All these ideas have been refuted by serious scholars (including secular ones) long ago. Jesus was not married to Mary Magdalene and didn't sire children with her. Constantine didn't invent the Christian Bible. In fact, all or most of the New Testament (NT) was written 200 years earlier. Nor was Constantine the first to declare Jesus a God. His purported divinity is spelled out already in the NT, most clearly in the Gospel of John, written around AD 100. The Gnostic gospels, in which Mary Magdalene is portrayed as the chief disciple of Jesus, were written long after the NT Gospels. Besides, the Gnostics also regarded Jesus as divine! Et cetera.<br /><br />Thus, the movie doesn't expose any cover-up. Rather, it and Dan Brown's novel are themselves part of a cover-up. Brown wants to replace one religious myth (the Christian) with another (his own). I'm not a Christian, but the Church is at least a public institution, with a public message. Dan Brown's alternative is presumably a secret sex cult, carrying out bizarre rituals reminescent of Satanic ritual abuse, and led by a Grand Master with a penchant for pentagrams and other Satanist paraphernalia. In the movie, the members of this secret society, "The Priory of Zion", are depicted as the good guys. By contrast, "The Teacher", who wants to expose both the Church and the Priory, thereby ending ALL conspiracies for good, is one of the bad guys!<br /><br />In fact, I found Teabing or the Teacher to be the only sympathetic person in the entire movie, a sort of expose-em-all David Icke character (and I must admit that I don't usually like Icke).<br /><br />Incidentally, who engineered the car accident that killed Sophie's father and mother anyway? The movie never says, but we are left with the impression that it might have been the Priory after all. Thus, the "good" guys.<br /><br />So the muckracker is the bad guy, and the secret manipulative Satanic cult are not really Satanists at all, but jolly nice people. Oh yeah? So why do they operate in secret, then? Obviously, because they have something to hide, not only from "the council of shadows", but from the rest of us as well. It might be well to remember that many of the ideas in Dan Brown's novel originally comes from Pierre Plantard, a French right-wing extremist. Besides, the conspiracy theory of history is usually associated with the far right of the political spectrum. These essentially elitist and fascist ideas have then been neatly edited into a vaguely "New Age" version and voila, we have "The Da Vinci Code".<br /><br />Make no mistake about it. "The Da Vinci Code" might be a bad movie, but the ideas behind it are even worse. Not just for the odd traditional Christian, but for all of us. Sincerely, do you want a world ruled by the Priory of Zion? If forced to chose, I rather go with the most boring, philistine Anglican vicar!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>It is very difficult for me to rate this film.

On another level, it is a movie built on fantasy, an attention-grabbing chronicle based on false premises and half-truths which attempt to undermine the Christian church's view of Jesus Christ.  This factor nagged at me throughout the film and I was not able to just forget about it and enjoy the movie as so many people advocate.  Debates have raged over the movie and the book, but the attack on the divinity of Christ is an insurmountable barrier for me, and the thought of profiting from these untruths makes this film a disturbing one for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>howard found a way.this was so bad,i had to cut the line to get out of my own house.buy this for someone you really hate!</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>Dear me.

The mockers and blasphemers are coming forward in great numbers, just as Jesus said they would, determined to recast the Son of God in deceptive New Age terms or to dismiss Him all-together. In doing so, they are paving the way for the Antichrist who will deceive the whole world into accepting him as the Messiah.<br /><br />The big bad beast does not make an appearance in Howard's film, but his coming is alluded to in the climax. The figure whom, it is suggested, is the only one worthy to possess the Holy Grail could be no one else. It certainly isn't the real Christ because the pursuit of some so-called Holy Grail is pure idolatry as warned against by God. Placing mystical value on any object, be it the chalice that Jesus sipped from during the Last Supper, or the spear that pierced His side during the crucifixion, or the Shroud of Turin, is Satanic in origin, emphasizing that which has been created rather than the Creator himself.<br /><br />As for DaVinci, it is well-known that he was a member of several secret societies, the likes of which still flourish today, to carry out the devil's plan to blind our eyes to the truth. Any "codes" in his work are in service to that lying devil of old and reveal nothing but his own corruption.<br /><br />On a purely cinematic level, "The DaVinci Code" is still a bust. This is third-rate Indiana Jones stuff, poorly made and indifferently acted. With the kinks in his hair ironed out, Tom Hanks looks like...well, I'll leave it to you to choose the private anatomical part he most resembles. The two-time Oscar winner's seemingly invulnerable career hit a bump in the road around the time of "The Terminal." His presence in a film based on a cheap pop culture phenomenon may have temporarily stalled his decline, but in the long run it may only accelerate it. Ian McKellon is so obnoxious here that I wanted to slap him.<br /><br />As for Ron Howard, he probably should have stayed in Mayberry. He wouldn't have gone on to a directing career or an Oscar, but as the Bible asks, "What doth it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?"<br /><br />Brian W.

Consequently, I was just able to go along with the movie and enjoy how the cinematic adaptation of Dan Brown's novel played out. However, I realize that this is a point of equilibrium that will not apply to most reviewers, because on the one hand there will be those who have not read the novel who might have trouble keeping up with all the pieces, while on the other there will be devotes of the book who will be anguished by everything left out or changed in the transformation from novel to film.<br /><br />At the Musee de Louvre in Paris, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is shot by a a mysterious figure in a monk's habit named Silas (Paul Bettany). Before he dies Sauniere leaves a series of clues, which point to Langdon, a Harvard professor whose forte is religious symbols. Captain Fache (Jean Reno) of the Paris police is convinced Langdon is the murderer, but Langdon is helped to escape by Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the granddaugther of the murdered man, who believes Langdon can decipher the clues. Langdon needs the help of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), an expert on the legends of the Holy Grail, to understand what is really at stake. Meanwhile, both Fache and Silas are chasing after Langdon and Sophie, spurred on by the machinations of Bishop Arigarosa (Alfred Molina).<br /><br />I cannot speak for those who have not read the book, But I certainly do not think that director Ron Howard has made a thriller simply because the story revolves around thinking and talking more than anything else, so I would qualify it as more of a mystery than anything else. Certainly it does not have the frenetic energy of the modern thriller movie, where the camera never stands still because you might actually see what is happening on screen. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay focuses on Robert Langdon as a problem solver and leaves the heavy exposition to the Leigh Teabing character. Langdon is more of a skeptic in this version, which allows him to be more reasonable than the true believers.  Actually, what might be the most fascinating part of the movie is when we first meet Langdon and he is lecturing on symbols and using visual aids to show that symbols are meant to be interpreted (which I take to be the caveat they provided instead of the disclaimer in the opening credits many insisted upon).<br /><br />Langdon makes a key distinction at one point when he tells Sophie that the complicated situation in which they find themselves involves people who believe that all of these stories about Mary Magdalene et. al is true. The distinction is important because ultimately "The Da Vinci Code" does not have to convince us that any of this is true, but rather than there are people who believe it and that those beliefs help to solve the various clues. The book's puzzles are greatly reduced in the movie, while the significance of the story of Mary Magdalene grows in relationship. There will be those who are disappointed by the former, and those who will be scandalized by the latter.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>If I had to sum THE DAVINCI CODE up in one word, it would be lackluster.  It's the kind of movie that will have its defenders. But for the most part, they will be defending Dan Brown's Novel, not Ron Howard's movie.  It's not that the film is incompetent.  It just doesn't try hard enough.  It sits there never quite compelling you to do anything but watch it.  It's a thriller with very little thrills.<br /><br />Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks),  Harvard University's most gifted Symbologist,  is in Paris giving a lecture on his new book.  When he is accidentally thrown into the middle of a murder investigation, in which he is the prime suspect.  His only allies are Sophie Neveu, the murdered man's granddaughter, and Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric brit with a passion for the holy grail.  Langdon must outrun an over zealous police chief (Jean Reno), a psychotic Albino Monk (Paul Bettany), and a mysterious man called only The Teacher.  In the process he stumbles over the biggest mystery of our age: just what is the Holy Grail?<br /><br />Director Ron Howard does his best to keep us interested in the story.  It's been simplified and changed drastically from the source material, probably so  that modern moviegoers can grasp the material a little easier.  The thing that surprised me most about the changes in the story,  were how they dramatically changed Robert Langdon's character motivations. The Langdon of Dan Brown's famous novel is an expert in the Grail symbology  and goes as far as to defend it to Sophie.  In the film he plays more of the Devil's Advocate questioning more and going as far as to call most of it bunk.  This changes the end of the film dramatically taking a bit of real passion out of it. In essence you're left with a postmodern twist on the story that zaps a lot of meaning out of the plot.<br /><br />Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman script shies away from the controversy of Dan Brown's book, it feels as if the producers sensed a boycott and got cold feet.  I think it hurts the film. Honestly, if your going to court controversy you should jump full in.  If not you've lost the battle.  Now I wished I hadn't slaved through Brown's book.  The film doesn't fill you with much desire to read the book it's based on.<br /><br />On a purely cinematic level it fails because it's not all that compelling.  None of the characters are drawn full enough for you to care about them.  They are lost in a film that has a point A and a point B, but the journey to get there is paved with boring car chases, fake drama, sloppy gunplay and incredibly stilted reveals.  No one seems to have any honest motivation, and problems are solved but not explained.  For instance Langdon and Sophie have this thing called a cryptex, they need to solve a code to get a piece of paper out of it.  But instead of showing us how Langdon figured out the code it just jumps to him solving it.<br /><br />My favorite moment was when Langdon and Sophie need to get to a library to figure out a riddle.  In Dan Brown's novel they spend hours in a library, in the film Sophie borrows some random guy's cell phone and they figure it out on a bus.  I chuckled.<br /><br />All in all THE DAVINCI CODE is the kind of movie that's made to cash in on one of the most popular books in recent history.  Its got star power, its got a big name director, its got a giant budget.  But it's missing a human touch.  It's missing a central heart.  It's not a film about people.  It's a film that just sits there and then fades to black.  Amidst the controversy, amidst the hype, the boycotts, and the millions it will rake in at the box-office THE DAVINCI CODE is much "ado about nothing."</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Why are so many critics bashing this movie?! I've been excited about seeing "The Da Vinci Code" on the big screen ever since I read Dan Brown's novel. As soon as I saw the first trailer for the film, I knew it would be good...and I was right!<br /><br />In case you're one of the few people in the world who still hasn't read the book, let me give you a brief rundown of the plot: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard University professor who is in Paris for a lecture. One night he is mysteriously summoned to the Louvre by an inspector (Jean Reno) who is investigating the murder of the elderly curator, which has taken place inside the museum. The murder victim left a series of symbolic codes at the crime scene before his death, and at first Robert believes that the police have asked for his help because of his work as a symbologist. However, French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) arrives on the scene and manages to inform Robert that he is actually a suspect in the case and is in grave danger. Robert and Sophie manage to escape and work together to decipher the mysterious codes that the curator left specifically for them to find. Soon they find themselves in the middle of a mystery that dates back thousands of years and revolves around a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. As they race around Paris and London and enlist in the help of Robert's eccentric former colleague (Ian McKellen), they find themselves targets of Opus Dei, an organization sanctioned by the Vatican that is intent on preserving the biggest secret of the Catholic church, which if revealed has the potential to forever alter Christianity and much of history in general.<br /><br />I was extremely impressed with the way director Ron Howard brought Brown's novel to life. The use of flashback sequences and three-dimensional graphics to help the audience decipher the code along with Robert and Sophie was an excellent choice. The film was exciting and suspenseful from beginning to end, just like the book. The actors were perfectly cast in their roles. Hanks, Tautou, Reno, and McKellen all had great chemistry together and stayed very true to Brown's characters. Everything in the movie looked exactly the way I pictured it when I was reading the book. It was great to see so many famous European buildings and landmarks on the screen. I also thought that the film's score was wonderful and really enhanced the suspenseful moments of the movie.<br /><br />Any film that is adapted from a book is bound to omit some details and there were a few tiny things missing from the movie, but overall I think almost everything (and certainly everything important) was left intact. Howard chose to tone down a few things that he felt might offend the religious community the most. For example, I think the Bishop's role in the movie was limited slightly in the film compared to the book, and the religious officials didn't seem quite as evil onscreen as they do in print. Sophie's flashback of the "ritual" she witnessed at her grandfather's home as a child was also toned down a lot. I also noticed a few details from the film that seemed to be changed for no reason at all...in Brown's novel, Jacques Sauniere really IS Sophie's biological grandfather, but the movie explains things a bit differently. Also, why did the filmmakers choose to omit the appearance of Sophie's brother at the end of the movie? I guess it didn't really take away from the film as a whole, but the guy who is supposed to be Sophie's brother in the book was actually IN the movie...they just never mentioned the fact that he was her brother! That struck me as being kind of pointless and odd. Finally, Robert and Sophie didn't share a kiss at the end of the movie. Brown always led his readers to believe that those two characters hook up in the end...a kiss on the forehead just doesn't cut it!<br /><br />Brown's novel, while incredibly entertaining, is very poorly written in places and also lacks cohesiveness throughout. In a lot of ways, I think Howard's movie is better organized than the book...the transitions are a lot smoother and the story isn't as "all over the place" as the novel sometimes is. I still think the book is great and I encourage people to read it before heading to the theatre to see the film. There is a lot more detail in the book that couldn't possibly be included in the movie, and since there is so much going on in the film, the story might be easier for people to follow if they've read the book.<br /><br />A lot of controversy has surrounded the book "The Da Vinci Code" and now surrounds the film. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. This is just a story...fiction. There are so many theories about Jesus and Mary Magdalene and Christianity in general. Just because a person chooses to read "The Da Vinci Code" or see the movie doesn't mean they are in any way forsaking the church. It's entertainment! I think the church and its leaders just make things worse for themselves when they throw fits about things like this.<br /><br />Overall, I loved "The Da Vinci Code!" This movie couldn't really have been any better. Everyone should go see it in the theatre...it's fun, exciting, suspenseful, and it will give you a lot to think about!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition) (2006)- I absolutely loved this five star movie and recommend it to everyone who loved the Dan Brown novel as well as those unfamiliar with the book.<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautouu were excellent and Ron Howard and his entire team did an outstanding job (of writing, acting, direction, filming, editing, make up, sets, CGI, special effects, music, etc.). Even the smaller roles were very well cast with an excellent international crew.<br /><br />Did I notice Lynn Picnett and Clive Prince, two conspiracy researchers (and authors of The Templar Revelation), make cameo appearances in the scene filmed on the bus? These two folks appeared in the documentary entitled "Angels and Demons". Lynn Picnett also appears in another documentary entitled "Unlocking DaVinci's Code, Mystery or Conspiracy".</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Critics of "The Da Vinci Code", both the book and the movie, tend to take the story way too seriously.  To me, Dan Brown's tale is just meant to be a thinking person's roller coaster ride, and a kind of thoughtful "what if...?"  The author wasn't purporting to write non-fiction, just a great campfire tale that takes many age-old theories, rumors and (to many) beliefs and run with them to great effect.<br /><br />With all its intentionally shocking ideas, I enjoyed the playful subversion of the book, so I was initially a little diappointed that the movie version pulls back from these ideas a little, primarily by making the Robert Langdon character more of a skeptic and defender of the status quo than he was in the book.  But, in the end, this worked out, as skeptics get to enjoy the movie a little more because their own positions are represented in the film, and- when the subversive stuff eventually does hit- it has more of an impact.<br /><br />Some critics also derided the film simply on the basis of its acting, pacing, etc.  But, I don't know... with all its mysteries, clues, chases, confrontations, and revelations, I think the movie is plenty entertaining, exciting and suspenseful.  Even seeing it again on DVD after catching it in theaters, the two hours-plus flew by.<br /><br />The second disc, containing generous bonus features, is good fun, too.  It was especially interesting to hear Dan Brown talk extensively about the whole phenomenon of the book and the choices that were made in adapting it to film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5.  I'm saying this a lot lately.  The Da Vinci Code is such a thinking thriller that it's nearly impossible to really capture on film.  I like Hanks, but I do have to agree with the critics on this one, he was absolutely boring as Robert Langdon.  The screenplay adaption absolutely doesn't make sense because when the film is over you're thinking-why didn't Teabing just leave the monk in France and just go on the adventure with his friends.  They trusted him at the time and were committed to solving the riddles.  Freeing the monk and the subsequent shoot out and chasing suddenly doesn't make any sense-since we're approaching this from a scholarly position.  The thing about The Da Vinci Code, it's sort of a one trick pony,  Once you know the secret it's sort of hard to then watch it and be pulled into the chase a second time.  (Indian Jones-it's not)  But The Da Vinci Code made too much money for it to be ignored by Hollywood and Howard's version may be as close to transforming the thinking thriller as anyone is going to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The `Da Vinci Code' is one of those love it, or hate it films. I will openly admit here and now at the beginning of my review that my opinion is somewhat biased by the fact that I just love this mystico/spiritual, conspiracy type of material, so there was little doubt I was going to enjoy the movie no matter what. The subject matter alone earns this film an unqualified 3 Stars.<br /><br />With 288 reviews on-line to date there's no need for me to give a synopsis. I would however like to say that upon viewing the film I found myself quite pleased with the end result. Production values, cinematography, acting and script were first rate as all Ron Howard productions are. While the film may not have lived up to expectations placed on it by many, especially those who read the novel, I do think it has accomplished its goal and will generate a great deal of late night conversation and re-evaluation of personal paradigms and long held beliefs. That in itself makes this film a worthwhile watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>When I first heard they were going to turn the Da Vinci Code into a motion picture I was disappointed.  It would made a much better mini-series, and I still believe that; however, hats off to Ron Howard (director) and Akiva Goldsman (writer) for making a film that captures the true essence of the novel.  What they chose to leave out works and the main storyline remains untouched from the novel.  I also wasn't thrilled when I heard Tom Hanks had been cast in the lead role of Robert Langdon, and while his performance was good I still think he was too old for the role.  A man in his middle to late thirties would have been a better choice than the aging, pudgy Hanks.  Regardless of this small gripe The Da Vinci Code, as a movie, was very good.  Even though I've read the novel upon which it is based twice, I still found myself on the edge of my seat as I watched the film.  if you liked the novel, you will like the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Puzzles are fun.  `The Da Vinci Code' provides this fun with a provocative story line that immediately grabs one's interest.  Intrigue is the film's hallmark.  To be brief, we start out with the murder of a professor who is a link to a "code" kept secret by Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (A ring around Rosa-!) (Alfred Molina, also "Doctor Oct," `Spiderman II') who is the ecclesial leader of Opus Dei, a secret sect of the Catholic Church.  To cover their crimes, they frame American Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks), who can't help but become a reluctant investigator. He links with Agent Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the granddaughter of the slain professor.  From the murder's beginning, they are surrounded at the Louvre Museum by the police and the bishop's protege', Silas (Paul Bettany), a cruel and misguided murderer.  It provides for a continuing and suspenseful chase.  The drama unfolds a "treasure hunt" as Langdon relates, and we are fed clues to keep our interest going.  Being an expert at historical symbols, Langdon correctly keeps the chase going to crack "the code" with Da Vinci leading the way with clever clues.  When stumped we come into the company of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan) whose offering is the crux of `The Da Vinci' controversy.  The suspenseful and absorbing chase is interrupted periodically by flashbacks meant to psychoanalyze the key players with backgrounds of faith that are tainted by abuse and misfortune.  (Certainly, the self-immolation of Silas is linked to a faith fostered by abuse.  Or at least he didn't take St. Ignatius's advice that these acts of penance are meant to be a gesture of repentance--not a means of self-torture.)  The resolution is a mixed bag:  It provides answers but is less awe-inspiring than the suspense that precedes it.<br /><br />Appeal will be mixed.  As entertainment, it sustains a mysterious atmosphere and a harrowing chase.  Splitting with the movie has to do with its controversial rendering.  Most people agree that Professor Teabing is the novelist Dan Brown's mouthpiece.  For those who believe the story is historical fiction, they are delighted at the iconoclastic nature of the movie.  For those who believe the story is fanciful fiction are often infuriated with the film.  Sir Teabing says the Catholic Church is an agent of "oppression and brutality" and asks, "What if the greatest story ever told is a lie?"  He refers to the bible.  Tom Hanks, as the modern equivalent of the James Stewart everyman, says "We've been dragged into a world where people believe it's [the Holy Grail] real?"  The bottom line is "Believe what you want to believe," which is borrowing a line from the Moody Blues who said, "...And we decide which is right and which is an illusion."<br /><br />(Let the Christians be offended.  After all, what if the movie was switched and we had the same movie with clues to show that Moses was really gay, or Mohammed frequented brothels?  Could this be passed off as "fiction," fanciful or historical?  The Dutch cartoonists last spring suggest that it could not.)</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>The dense plot complexities of Dan Brown's novel around the pursuit of the Holy Grail made it a thoroughly entertaining read, but the unending plethora of detail looks contrived and ultimately predictable when translated onscreen. Having Ron Howard helm this 2006 production assures a mainstream-oriented consciousness would predominate, but unfortunately, it also means a lack of pervasive invention when it comes to conveying the dramatic twists and turns of Brown's story. Moreover, Akiva Goldsman's screenplay requires scenes of lengthy exposition which Howard tries to offset with fantasy visualizations of speculative religious history. However, the core problem is that the filmmakers' diligent attempts at remaining faithful to the book make the movie feel overstuffed within its lengthy running time of 149 minutes.<br /><br />For those who don't know, the focus of the plot is on the hunt for the secrets hidden by the Priory of Sion including the Holy Grail. Some want to protect it, some want to expose it, and some want to destroy it. Harvard professor Robert Langdon and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, equipped with secrets shared by the murdered curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauni&eacute;re, are a step ahead of the police, assassins, and churchmen in full pursuit. After what looks to be a standard murder mystery set-up, the story finally gains momentum in the second hour with the creatively handled explanation for the hidden meanings behind Da Vinci's "Last Supper". A historical labyrinth is presented piecemeal, incorporating the origins of the gospels and the assimilation of pagan rituals and symbols into the early church's practices, all of which showcases the revelatory role of Mary Magdalene in scripture. While Langdon is the nominal protagonist, Sophie emerges as the pivotal character here, especially as they recognize how her past provides keys to vital information that could change history and religion.<br /><br />Casting is a challenge here since the actors are really there merely to support the convoluted storyline. As dazzling as she has been in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films, Audrey Tautou of "Amelie" fame is comparatively constrained as Sophie, though she also seems a bit burdened by the verbosity of the role. As Langdon, a lank-haired Tom Hanks is more problematic as his versatility is sorely tested by playing an academically-oriented sleuth. Stealing scenes easily is Ian McKellan as erudite, Grail-obsessed Sir Leigh Teabing. On the other hand, Paul Bettany merely exhibits a fairly one-note malignancy as the murdering albino monk Silas. Also left to their own elliptical devices are Jean Reno as the secretive Captain Fache and Alfred Molina as Opus Dei's designated kingpin, Bishop Sringarosa. The film's plodding pace is offset somewhat by Salvatore Totino's superb cinematography, especially at the Louvre and other European locales.<br /><br />Thinking back  on the film, I keep wondering if it could have benefited more from a fresher director like Darren Aronofsky or Christopher Nolan, or even Quentin Tarantino's pulpish approach since the kinetic thriller elements are ripe enough for his cinematic audacity. The two-disc 2006 DVD set is certainly full of extras. Disc One contains the movie and several previews for upcoming theatrical releases. Disc Two has all the extras, which consist mainly of ten featurettes on various aspects of the production and its translation from Brown's hugely successful novel. The best of the bunch is "The Codes of the Da Vinci Code", which has Howard and Brown explain much of the symbolism used specifically in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>The 2003 novel "The Da Vinci Code" was one of the best novels I've read in years. It was one of the most adventurous novels that opened up an immense fascination with the topic of Christianity as a faith but especially with the history, both good and bad, of the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church. thus was very much anticipating the big screen adaption of the novel "The Da Vinci Code". To my utter, surprise, I think that it actually does an excellent job of doing the book justice to a high degree, even though the book version like all novels is far superior to any possible screen remakes possible. This movie is absolutely a phenomenal movie that I highly recommend seeing at the movie theatre!<br /><br /> The movie begins with an elderly man at the Louvre who is brutally murdered by an albino assassin named Silas. At the same time a lecture by a professor named Robert Langdon who is about to give a speech before a audience when a murder of an elderly man at the Louvre museum in Paris France, grabs the attention of Langdon. As Langdon researches the clues of the paintings and Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, he discovers that the murder victim left a series of messages that contained secrets about the legend of Jesus Christ, his wife Mary Magdalene, and the possibility of there being descendants who are still alive in the present who carry on the truth about Christ's life. Joined by a French cryptologist named Sophie Neveu, Langdon discovers that the elderly man who was murdered was in fact a member of a secret society called the Priority of Sion.<br /><br />The two also discover a golden truth about a Holy Grail that has been `hidden' for over two thousand years that if revealed to the general public, threatens to shake the very foundations of Christianity as a religion.  However, the two find themselves trying to stay ahead of agents of Opus Dei, a hard-line fundamentalist Catholic organization, that vows to prevent the truth of the church from coming out as well as prevent the "Holy Grail" from being found. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the numerous complex puzzles and figure out the ancient artifacts, the "Holy Grail" will end up being lost forever. It is believed according to the movies timeline that the Catholic Church is based on dubious, if not outright false pretenses on the truth of Jesus Christ and the Vatican is using the false basis as a means to stay in power by deliberately covering up the truth about the life of Christ as well as the story of his supposed wife Mary Magdalene and their descendants.<br /><br /> This movie in my opinion, actually does a great job of making an awesome novel into an actual movie. Granted, the book is far superior to the movie but for a movie adaptation, "The Da Vinci Code" ranks as one of the best screen adaptations I've seen in recent years. There is rarely, if ever, a dull moment throughout the entire movie. The whole topic of religion and faith, even though I'm technically a Presbyterian (I was baptized a Presbyterian when I was two), is fascinating. The movie has renewed my interest in learning more about the `official' as well as the true history of Christianity as well as it's numerous denominations and branches, both Catholic and Protestant as well as other branches of the religion.<br /><br /> I was totally surprised to actually see that Sir Ian McKellan actually stars in this movie as the eccentric researcher Leigh Teabigh as he helps the two find the artifacts and solve the puzzles before the clandestine Opus Dei and it's agents find it and hide it forever from the outside world. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice for the role of Robert Langdon. Even as I read the novel itself, I for some reason actually envisioned Tom Hanks playing him in the movie and to my pleasant surprise, was proven right all along. Though I don't want to change the subject too much in this review, Hanks is the most flexible actor I know of, as he plays the best average-joes in movies. He can play almost all kinds of characters, both good and evil. Paul Bettamy is scary as the albino assassin Silas with the scary looking eyes and facial expressions throughout the movie. Even more surprising was Alfred Molina who played Doctor Octavius in Spiderman 2 two years before then. Molina is great as the priest of the Prion of Sion who is loyal to the Teacher of the organization.<br /><br /> The book and movie have come under enormous criticism from the Catholic Church as well as other Christian sects for what is believed to be fabrications and distortions of the truth. The "Da Vinci Code" is a fictional book and thus I can't say I believe that all of the things are necessarily true. However, I do believe that there is a large amount of truths that are out there about the life of Jesus Christ that have yet to see the light of day. Anyhow, back to the movie, "The Da Vinci Code" is among the best novel adaptations that I've seen in years. I strongly recommend seeing this movie today!</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I am usually wary of books that are turned into films. "Memoirs of a Geisha" turned out to be a disappointment when I saw the film adaptation. I was a bit wary when I heard that "The Da Vinci Code" was going to be turned into a movie but all suspicions were put to rest when I saw a trailer for it a month or two ago.<br /><br />The premise of the film revolves around the death of an elderly art curator who leaves behind a series of clues to a box that contains a map to the Holy Grail and from there a 2 1/2 hour rollercoaster thrill ride. Tom Hanks plays symobologist Robert Langdon who is the prime suspect in the death of the curator. With the assistance from Sophie Neveu (the lovely Audrey Tatou), the pair. The duo immediately sets off on a journey which involves a box with a five petal rose, inside what may possibly be a map to the holy grail.<br /><br />I have read the novel and the film adaptation is pretty spot on. There were a few minor alterations but nothing major. I personally enjoyed the film for what it was which is entertainment. Do I believe that Jesus and Mary Magdelene had a child and she survived to continue on their bloodline? No. Both the book and the novel is purely fictional.<br /><br />What I liked about the film was the build up in suspense through out the film. I personally thought Ron Howard did a pretty good job on creating an aura of suspense in the scenes involving Silas (Paul Bettany) or when Robert and Sophie were running from the cops. I loved Hans Zimmer's orchestral score. It fit perfectly with the theme of the film.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film is Ron Howard's addiction to flashback scenes. Like Peter Jackson, Ron just does not know how to edit his films. I admit I liked the flashback scenes but after awhile they got annoying. Any wonders why I don't see Ron's films in the theatre, it is because they are too freaking long. Tom Hanks may be a good actor but I felt that someone else probably could have been a more convincing Robert Langdon.  I loved the supporting cast though. I found his long hair in the film rather distracting. It looked like Peppe LePew the skunk died on top of his head.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed "The Da Vinci Code" as a movie and nothing more. I liked the twists and turns in the storyline. Ian McKellan was a lot of fun to watch as well as Paul Bettany as the creepy Silas. For all its flaws, "The Da Vinci Code" is a solid summer blockbuster film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>Can't say whether it's an advantage or not, not to have read the book. I haven't; but I've read The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, by Earl Teabag, so I had some idea what to expect. It didn't help much in following the track of puzzles, none of which seemed to be properly solved. After about 10 minutes the movie lost me, but I didn't mind watching it to the end. I'd given up long before, so nothing much mattered. There were interesting parts: I thought the brisk analysis of the geometry underlying Leonardo's Last Supper was interesting. This is certainly one of the world's most fascinating paintings. Audrey is a sweetie, and I thought she was OK. The men weren't that impressive, although the blue-eyed albino had a bit of presence: couldn't figure out what he was doing in the story, sadly. The others might have been better if they'd had better parts to play, with better dialogue. They seemed dazed most of the time, just like me. As for the story: well, Leigh Baigent's ideas are quite interesting to read, but they don't convince and don't add up to much, like everybody says. The producers must have been delighted by the bans on religious grounds, here and there. Christ's basic principles (if he ever existed) boil down to love your neighbour and turn the other cheek. Can't say, considering its history, the Catholic church has applied them to any great extent. Nor have many other religions, for that matter, though there may be one or two exceptions. Too concerned with enforcing their beliefs on others, and being boss. Unfortunately Christ's ideas may be OK in theory, but the first one is very often almost impossible to implement, and the second simply doesn't work in practice. Might as well put your head in a noose. Ah well, Audrey is welcome to call me, and give the theories a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I've read the other reviews here, however, I have not read the book.

The filming, special effects, acting and soundtrack all come together to present a superb mystery/though provoking movie.<br /><br />The premise of the film is simple. What if modern religion is/was a lie? What if Jesus WAS indeed a human? Would that not shake the very foundations that so many religions were forged upon? Indeed it would. Countless lives, battles, wars and crusades were carried out. More lives have been lost in the name of religion than for any other cause. Religions were the rock of governments for centuries even!<br /><br />If all of that came into question, it stands to follow that everything would then be questioned. Hence the premise for this film.<br /><br />In order to preserve societies and the world, as well as people's beliefs and lives even, a secret society was formed. To protect the world from the truth. So, if you can bring it into your mind that what we know today as religious history is a lie you can understand how unearthing the truth would shatter lives everywhere.<br /><br />The further mystery is... what exactly is the truth? And what do we do with it when we find it?<br /><br />All in all I would say that would be a most devastating blow to mankind. The way this movie plays it all out, with twists and turns, is done to perfection. It's part cat-and-mouse, part treasure hunt, part murder mystery and a big part of moral and ethical questioning.<br /><br />If you like a really good mystery that provokes much deeper and broader thinking, you will definitely like this movie. Nothing comes close in this realm. And, if you did like this movie you should read 'Another Roadside Attraction' and/or 'Skinny Legs and All', both by Tom Robbins.</p></br></body></html>
