Nothing more... no saving the world or anything.<br /><br />In the meantime, a bank robbery begins, with multiple hostages taken, demands made, a hostage killed and hostages beaten, and rescues thwarted.  Then... the bank is stormed, and everybody comes out... except the robbers.  Where are the guns?  The explosives?  The dead hostage?  The robbers?<br /><br />Perhaps there was an inside man.<br /><br />Great excitement, with nifty twists and turns.  The one curious issue is the role, and character, of Jodie Foster as "the discrete problem fixer."  "My bite is worse than my bark," she says.  But this character never seems tough, or rough.  It is a mystery why Foster was cast for this character.<br /><br />You are never really sure who is "the inside man," or even the robbers.  I might have to see it again, and pay closer attention.  But that's okay, because it is a sponge-worthy film.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>With an all-star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending,  Inside Man is an above-average heist thriller.  However, as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary, and Inside Man is no exception.  At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America.  From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold.  I liked that part of the movie, but I can understand how others are bored with Lee's tactics.  Overall, the plot, direction, and all-star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Though Foster is featured prominently on the cover, this movie really stars Washington and Owen, with Foster appearing not nearly long enough.  This was a clever and well thought out movie.  A bank robbery that is not all that it should be with Owen leading the thieves and Washington as the detective in charge of the negotiations.  A cat and mouse game between the two ensues, and you never really know who will come out on top.  Though the ending was satisfying, it fell a little short of being a surprise, shock or a feel good type of conclusion.  Very good acting highlights this movie.  I might watch this one again to see if I missed anything the first time around, but I am not sure if I will purchase it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I have liked Spike Lee's films over the years and found "Inside Man" to be a refreshing addition to his long list of excellent films.  Probably the last thing one would expect of Mr. Lee is that he would direct a thriller, but he has given us one of the best in recent memory.<br /><br />This is a film that keeps you on the edge; you are not sure where it is going to go next.  The battle of wits between Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is like a chess game with each plotting strategy and sometimes finding they have been outwitted.  Both Washington and Owen are excellent in their roles and truly convince you that they are a detective and bank robber.  Jody Foster is also excellent as Madeline White, a kind of corporate enforcer who is hired to look after the interests of wealthy banker Arthur Chase (Christopher Plummer), who has something in a safe deposit box that needs to stay put.  Ms. Foster plays her roll coolly with the knowledge that she can convince anyone to do what she wants.  Her character clearly has either good political connections or enough dirt on people to get what she wants when she wants it.  She manages to twist the Mayor into letting her in to negotiate with Dalton Russell with him clearly being blackmailed into allowing it.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is good as a police captain but does not have enough screen time to make an impression.  One wonders how much of his part made it into the final cut.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent in his characterization of Arthur Chase, who in old age is regretful of what he has done in his past but not about to repent.  I liked Mr. Plummer's final scene in the film where he is paying Jody Foster for her successfully keeping his name clean.  When she says more to his face than he likes it is interesting to see Plummer wanting to say something in return but keeping the words to himself.<br /><br />The screenplay is the first from Russell Gewirtz and is impressive in the way he always keeps us guessing what is coming next and not resolving the story until the last scene of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Inside Man is a fascinating, suspenseful bank heist / hostage story. The robbers cleverly dress their hostages all in the same kind of diguises they're wearing, so the cops can't tell bad guys from victims.  But the fact they're taking time to implement such an elaborate scheme - rather than taking the money and escaping - seems to indicate they're after some particular thing other than the money.<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Willem Dafoe play cops handling the situation, Christopher Plummer is the bank president, who hires Jodie Foster, some sort of private eye, to try to prevent the robbers from getting some particular thing in the bank, other than the money.<br /><br />It's fascinating and suspenseful, well written and well-acted, and the only problem I had with the whole film was that they didn't explain, at the end, how the bank robbers knew in the first place about some particular thing they were after, other than the money. They do leave room for you to figure that out yourself, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>I'm one who enjoyed THE 25th HOUR and SUMMER OF SAM and to me, INSIDE MAN didn't hold up to the high standard of the other movies.  However it is still an extremely fun ride and two of the actors, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, deliver fantastic performances.  The jury is out on Clive Owen's accomplishments here.  OK, he's hampered by a mask but just the other day I saw what Hugo Weaving could do with an even bigger mask in V FOR VENDETTA and sorry, Clive Owen fans, your boy isn't really giving the part as much as he might.<br /><br />At the end I was a little bit puzzled about why the bank robbers had committed the crime.  Wish someone would explain it to me!  Was it just for the money--apparently not.  And why would our lead villain hold on for so many years to a document that incriminates him when he could have disposed of it at any time?  And also, how old is Christopher Plummer supposed to be, anyway?  I would say he would have to be around 90 for the story to really work.  Sorry, he doesn't look ninety.  However all these quibbles amount to Monday morning quarterbacking when one considers the brilliance of so much of the rest of Russell Gewirtz' ace screenplay, which gives us everything we want from a police procedural and more.<br /><br />Denzel's character this time out is a private man with strong ties to his job and his community but he's feeling those ties start to fray, especially when $140,000 worth of cash money has walked out the door under his watch during a recent check cashing sting operation, so for the first time he's on the defensive, very much so.  In his home life he is living with an extraordinarily sexy colleague whose young brother's a crackhead and lives in a cot together with them in a too-small apartment.  Situation volatile, but Keith Frazier doesn't sweat the small stuff.  Though it may seem as though Denzel has played this part a thousand times, he completely reinvents himself here and only once or twice does our normal Denzel sneak in, take a quick bow, and disappear again behind the Frazier mask.  I for one would enjoy seeing him and his partner solving another case, pitting against another super villain.  The partner is played by the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor who was also in Spike Lee's crazy SHE HATE ME movie.  But mostly I remember him from being the bad guy in SERENITY.<br /><br />My favorite however is Jodie Foster.  It's excellent that Foster seems to be returning to films in a big way, what with this, FLIGHT PLAN, that French movie, and upcoming a new picture with Terrence Howard.  Though some dislike her for being cold and controlling, here she takes her worst flaws and really plays them up as Madeline White.  And girl, she looks good in a NYC ivory linen power suit with her long, long legs and hip swinging walk.  She's playing a woman who likes men, a lot of men, a lot of dangerous men.  All in all a different kind of part for Jodie Foster, and she looks like she's having a ball, good for her.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that probably would have worked better as a novel than a movie.  The slow pacing left a lot to be desired. I was expecting something more brilliant than what was presented here. Dalton Russell's who, what, and when explanation was fine, but he definitely short-changed us on the why.  Why the heck did he care how Case made his money?  None of the robber's where Jewish.  How did he learn of his past if no one else knew?  Once Dalton and Ms. White had their little dicussion, hence, telling the audience the real deal, I was bored waiting for Det. Frazier and his crew to catch up.  Then I wasn't rewarded well enough for the wait.  Why was Dafoe in this movie?  have the acting gigs dried up that badly that he's taking parts that could have easily gone to a glorified extra?  Foster was good, wouldn't mind having her job.  Overall, it's just okay.  I like Washington more when he does character pieces compared to his action/thriller/ heist stuff.  I can rarely tell those characters apart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Spike Lee's latest New York story is being billed as his most commercial film yet and that's true to a certain extent. A star-powered heist flick with a number of good surprises up its sleeve, Inside Man is more concerned with entertaining the audience than lecturing at them. But the famously confrontational filmmaker hasn't completely sold out to The Man; while his brand of brash rhetoric is muted here, the movie still has the distinct look and feel of a Spike Lee joint.<br /><br />That's both good news and bad news. On the plus side, Lee's dynamic visual style is perfectly suited to the heist genre. His affection for sweeping Steadicam shots and cutting between different film stocks--often so distracting in his more dramatic efforts--ramps up the tension that's built into the already-gripping scenario. Smart cop Keith Frazer (Denzel Washington) squares off against ace bank robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). Marching into a lower Manhattan bank, Russell and his crew quickly take the 20-odd customers and employees hostage. Enter Frazer, who can tell right away that he's up against a formidable opponent. Whenever he thinks he has Russell figured out, a new wrinkle in the robber's plan emerges. Complicating matters further is the arrival of Madeline White (Jodie Foster), an independent operator that has been employed by the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer) to protect certain "interests" that she's not at liberty to divulge. As day turns to night, Frazer comes to realize that this isn't an open-and-shut bank robbery. The question is, what the heck is it?<br /><br />Comparisons to Dog Day Afternoon are inevitable (Washington's character even namechecks that film at one point) and it goes without saying that Inside Man isn't as memorable as Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic. This movie is slick and superficial where its predecessor was raw and angry and none of the central characters are as richly drawn as Dog Day's thwarted lovers Sonny and Sal. On its own terms, however, Inside Man is an above average cops 'n' robbers story and easily one of the better New York movies to come along in awhile. (It certainly puts the recent Bruce Willis vehicle 16 Blocks--with its generic locations and poor sense of Manhattan geography--to shame.) Lee populates the movie with plenty of recognizable Big Apple types and picks up on the little details about the city that other filmmakers often overlook. There's a hilarious moment where the cops sit around arguing whether or not Metro North trains run through Grand Central that should have local audiences cracking up.<br /><br />The other way you know that Inside Man is still a Spike Lee picture is because it suffers from some of his worst instincts as a director. He's still not above resorting to dubious stereotypes, particularly when it comes to Jewish characters. The movie also clocks in at over two hours and there are a number of places, like the lackluster final act, where the proceedings could have been tightened up. Part of the problem is Russell Gewirtz's screenplay, which builds an effective mystery only to offer a confusing, and rather unbelievable, resolution. The script's flaws are most keenly felt in the Jodie Foster storyline, to the point where her character seems more like a bumbling screw-up than a supposedly sought-after facilitator. Whenever Lee turns the camera back to Denzel and Clive though, the movie works. Like their director, these two pros know that they're taking part in a genre exercise, but bring plenty of personality to their standard-issue roles (the same goes for Willem Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor, who appear in small supporting parts). Lee may one day make his sell-out movie, but this one isn't it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>i love this film and its ensemble and frequently ("GET ON THE BUS" , "DO THE RIGHT THING" , "HE GOT GAME" , "CLOCKERS" , "SUMMER OF SAM") its director MR.

A top quality cast all give fine performances, resulting in an entertaining and intelligent film. This second quality is important, since we've all seen heist movies before, but this one adds something extra to proceedings by making the owner of the bank (the as always excellent Christopher Plummer) a leading player in film for reasons that only become obvious in the 2nd half of the film.<br /><br />This is more mainstream, than most Spike Lee films but he still stamps his own vision on the film. We should also be grateful that Spike realises the futility of buildings and cars exploding. Perhaps hollywood will learn one day. It goes without saying that the direction is good and the script equally so. Denzel Washington shares the acting honours with Plummer, if only because Clive Owen is behind a mask most of the time.<br /><br />I have only seen the film once, but can imagine that it will improve with a few more viewings.

This film is filled with interesting plot twists, mystery, suspense, sure-footed direction by Spike Lee, and well-acted by all involved.  I've always liked Lee's films, but this is his first truly "mainstream" film that all can enjoy.  I can't help but feel that Lee is winking at his critics with this film, "See I can do this kind of stuff.  That's IF I want to."<br /><br />This perfectly casted film is a great diversion that I think most will enjoy.

And Denzel is joined by other A-listers like Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer in this extremely well-done bank robbery movie...seemingly.<br /><br />Seemingly is the key word here. The robbers are trapped inside the bank and take hostages. As the situation escalates, Denzel's hostage negotiator character discovers that, as he says in the movie trailer, "this is no bank robbery", and the details of the criminal's more "perfect heist" are revealed.<br /><br />Spike Lee clearly has the talent to put together a classy, well executed action movie, and he will hopefully devote more of his talent to these kinds of films, because Inside Man really works.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Remember when Woody Allen released Match Point last year and instantly revamped his career, probably because the whole tone of the film had changed from his previous efforts. Here Spike Lee basically does that; He's not revamping his career, because it's been fine...But this movie has a whole different tone from Lee's previous films. And that's a good thing, because this is a very smart film that throws constant plot twists while always staying true to what's going on. Bank robbing movies are hard to do now a days. Not movies about bank robbers who rob banks occasionally in the movie (Bandits); I'm talking full-on entire movie in the bank, bank robbing movies. Back in the 70's "Dog Day Afternoon" pretty much wrote the book on those kinds of movies and how they should be; I don't think that films been topped. But this film (which also does something out of the ordinary in referencing bank robbing movies such as the aformentioned one) does something different with the bank robbery genre. The movie opens like the Johnny Depp film The Libertine did. A character, in this case Dalton Russel (Clive Owen), stares directly into the camera and explains that he's going to rob a bank for two reasons. One, because of the financial aspect and two, because he can. In the next few moments we watch a team of bank robbers, wearing masks and disguised as painters, storm into a bank in New York and commence the robbery. As soon as the cops get wind of it, it turns into Dog Day Afternoon outside the banks sans the media and screaming fans. Leading the pack of hostage negotiators is Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), a smart detective who see's something isn't quite right with the robbery. Christopher Plummer co-stars as the CEO of the bank Arthur Case, who's hiding something in one of the safety desposit boxes; Jodie Foster co-stars as Madeleine, the woman hired by Case to keep the contents of the safety desposit box secret; And Willem Dafoe stars as Captain John Darius, another cop involved in the hostage situation. The ending is really smartly done and believable in the context of the film. This is entertaining, smart, and very good.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Spike Lee<br /><br />Cast:  Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejifor, Carlos Andres Gomez, Kim Director, James Ransome.<br /><br />Running Time: 129 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for language and some violence.<br /><br />Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like "She Hate Me" and "Girl 6", Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while "Inside Man" is not up there with "Do The Right Thing", "Malcolm X" and "Clockers", it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.  A bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control, and it's up to police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case, since the leader of the bank robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), turns out to be a very smart individual, who has everything planned to perfection, and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous, he himself does not lose his mind, and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated, however, when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman (Jodie Foster) wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank, and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents.<br /><br />This all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller, but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot, because while "Inside Man" does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times, Inside Man is very funny, but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this film. Washington's Frazier is an intense but laconic individual, who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else, while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. Unfortunately, Jodie Foster's role is lackluster. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes, we all know that she is very good at that, but with a bit more background story, and a bit more screen time, her part could have been even more interesting.  With "Inside Man", Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers, which consists of an introduction, a chronological development of the main intrigue, followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly (even flashing forward several times, thus revealing some important developments before they have happened), and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie.  This unique approach is intriguing and enjoyable, even though it does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A film that is very well built as an action film, though the cops are trapped by the burglars with a microphone brought to them by a released hostage. How can New York policemen be that negligent and sloppy ? Apart from that, and maybe because of that, it all looks very convincing, though we know very fast what it is all about. The point is just to let us get involved in the bank robbery and in the naive unprofessionalism of the police and how they are fooled like little boys and girls that don't play games on their gameboys or consoles. This long and slow building of a logical mesmerizing plot is there to hide the final kick you will get in your brain without even realizing it and this punchline will nicely survive in your subconsciousness without even realizing it is there in your head : the Jews are invisible and dark plotters who do things in the back of everyone and know no law of any kind and no limit at all when they are trying to get some kind of a vengeance. That kind of a subliminal openly disagreeable punchline is absolutely irritating because it reveals the entertaining film you have been watching for more than two hours has a totally different objective and agenda.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>I have seen most of Spike Lee's previous films, admiring some more than others. To me, he resembles the proverbial little girl with the curl. That said, I think his Inside Man is very, very good in most respects. Four compelling screen actors so thoroughly inhabit the characters entrusted to them that -- as with Jamie Foxx in Ray and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote -- they are the characters whom they portray. I was intrigued by the lively interaction between and among Detective Keith Frazier, Madeline White, Dalton Russell, and Arthur Chase rather than recognizing Washington, Foster, Owen, and Plummer at work. One Star for that. I also admire Lee's juxtaposition of  volatile plot developments with moments of quiet, almost lyrical reflection. Another Star for pace. And praise, also,  to the cinematographer (Matthew J. Libatque), the composer of the score (Terence Blanchard), and especially the screenwriter Russell Gewitz) for collaborating so effectively with Lee to integrate image, sound, and dialogue from beginning to end. That's Three Stars so far.<br /><br />Add another for a meticulously planned bank robbery which Lee develops smoothly but unhurriedly within a multi-dimensional plot featuring the robbery itself as well as high-level power brokering within and beyond the NYPD and even City Hall. Lee and Gewitz share the credit for this. Others who have reviewed this film cite similarities with other films such as Dog Day Afternoon and there are a few but make no mistake about it: Inside Man is in no way derivative of any others. I think it is unique, albeit comparable with L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Pulp Fiction in terms of its brilliant examination of cultural ambiguities.<br /><br />As for the last Star, whether or not those who see this film share Lee's perspectives on race relations, whether or not they share his social values, I suggest that he is wholly consistent with those perspectives and values while exploring in this film a multiple of interpersonal relationships which include but are not --ultimately -- defined by racial issues. In fact, racial issues are subordinate to the narrative which he so carefully develops. The situation initially seems to be a crisis with life-or-death implications for the hostages as well as for those committed to rescuing them. By the end of this film, however, we realize that Lee's primary purpose is to tell an entertaining, at times compelling story rather than to exploit the on-going drama as a means by which to express a polemic.<br /><br />Well-done.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.<br /><br />Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them because they were disguised as painters.<br /><br />Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Spike Lee has never been known for his subtlety.  He makes powerful films that are often smart ("Do the Right Thing"), occasionally not ("She Hate Me"), and sometimes brilliant ("Malcolm X," "4 Little Girls"), but there is never any question that Spike's first goal is to make an emotionally powerful film.<br /><br />Lee departs drastically from past practice with "Inside Man," a hyper-smart heist movie that adopts all the tricks of the genre.  While no "heist movie" is ever going to rise to the hallowed heights of "The Sting" in movie lore, Lee has made one heck of an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays criminal ringleader Dalton Russell, and he tells the audience in the opening scene (shattering the fourth wall) that he has done a bank job, and here's how he did it.  In broad daylight, Russell leads a handful of thieves into the downtown Manhattan branch of a powerful bank, founded in 1948 by Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).  Within moments, Russell has taken about forty hostages and has the bank surrounded by cops and media.  And yet he hasn't touched the money and seems hardly perturbed.  Why?<br /><br />This question dogs lead detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his sidekick, Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  It's clear that Frazier and Mitchell are used to being smarter than the criminals they face, but Russell is clearly in a different league.<br /><br />Further muddying the waters is the appearance on the scene of Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) as a woman hired by Case to protect his interests in the bank . . . interests that are contained in security box 392.  Miss White (there's the trademark Lee subtlety at work) is the kind of person who gets to patronize the mayor of Manhattan and lord her power over mere mortals such as Detectives Frazier and Mitchell.  It's clear that Foster relishes this chance to play perhaps the biggest witch of her career, even if one wishes that Miss White were on screen a bit more.<br /><br />The heist proceeds through its paces with the typical cadence of move and countermove by police and criminal.  To summarize any more would be to give the game away, but like all great heist movies, "Inside Man" keeps you guessing right up until the very end.  The fact that upon reflection the whole story is completely ridiculous is beside the point - heist movies are more about style and wit than logic, and are at their best when one player is able to move among the others as if he or she has had an advance peek at the screenplay.<br /><br />Lee generally eschews his trademark focus on racial issues, and the few scenes where these arise feel contrived and beside the point.  Fortunately, Lee never lets the movie get bogged down in these moments, and to his credit, spends about as much time with sexism as he does racism.<br /><br />But never fear - this is an intelligent heist movie made by a talented, dedicated filmmaker.  Solid work by the entire cast makes "Inside Man" a pleasure to watch - Mr. Lee and his team should be very proud, and it's not surprising that this movie has been Lee's biggest box office hit yet, and a sequel appears to be in the works.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>So so movie - interesting intro but it degraded into boring scripts -- actually not too bad  but I didn't  have the patience so fast forward came handy before she leaves.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I really could not take anything out of this movie.  The middle of the film was quite suspenseful but the ending was strange I thought, almost like there was going to be a part 2.  Think I had seen that somewhere that there was going to be a part 2.

Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I've often found Spike Lee to be hit or miss as a director... This time around, it's a little in the middle.  "Inside Man" is a bank heist film, one of hundreds of films in a moribund corner of the crime film world. It's also a hostage-negotiation film, with Lee's four-time leading man, Denzel Washington, in the role of a police negotiator whose personal life is on the edge: at times he has the tactfulness of a falling anvil, and yet he is smart enough to match wits with the heist's mastermind, intensely played by Clive Owen.<br /><br />The mechanics and motivations of the heist itself are pretty compelling: this looks like a master plan that could work. Where the film fizzles in in the presentation of a plot beyond the clime, and the introduction of a rather ricketty set of circumstances involving municipal and corporate corruption (the bank's CEO is evil, and he leans on the mayor to obstruct the police in the middle of the hostage crisis -- not very likely) Jodie Foster plays a shadow-world heavy, hired by the CEO to make sure that his personal safety deposit box is not opened by the robbers (spoiler alert: it is their target) and, unbelievably, she is given access to the crime scene and spars briefly with Denzel, who despite his character's maverick nature, lets her meet with the bad guys.  This whole meta-plot is a dud -- it just rings false on every level, which is a shame, since the heist itself is kind of exciting.  If Lee had left well enough alone, and just made this an exciting genre film, it would have been fun.  The added-on political commentary seems grafted on and phony, it fails to resonate politically, and it an utter failure in dramatic terms.  That being said, the film is watchable and often engrossing, but it lacks the finesse and intensity of, say, Lee's far superior crime film, "25."  It's an okay film, but it lurches to the ending.

Detective Frazier (Washington) is the guy tasked with figuring out Russell's plan before the hostages start to die.<br />Inside Man's stock is raised by the presence of director Lee, who makes his most thrilling and enjoyable movie for some time. It's entertaining on almost every level.<br />Very good bank heist movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Inside Man is probably one of the best movies Spike Lee has ever made. I will admit, as many other reviewers have done, that this is probably Spike's best movie since "Malcom X," and, "Do The Right Thing." Denzel Washington [who can do no wrong with another stellar performance] teams with Spike Lee again in this highly charged movie that has you guessing from the moment of the classic line, "This ain't no bank robbery!"<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as NYPD detective/negotiator, Keith Frazier, who is placed in the difficult situation of a Wall Street bank robbery, where 40+ people are being held hostage by a genius bank robber, Dalton Russel [played by Clive Owen] Russel is the type of movie villian that you can't help but like. He is one determined, cool talking, take no chances man, who even claims to have the perfect bank robbery plan anyone has ever had. Frazier must match wits, brains, and intelligence with Russel in order to save the lives of the people in the bank.<br /><br />There are several scenes such as; Owen and Washington's characters bumping into each other right before the robbery takes place, and the other cops that don't believe Washington's character when he starts to wonder if there is more to this robbery than what it appears, that I found slighly annoying [since I had seen them in many other bank robbing movies]. But those are just minor things probably only myself care about [I can't help myself] and I guarantee you they won't bother the rest of the movie at all.<br /><br />I thought the best scenes were with with Frazier and Russel talking to each other, they seemed to have a war of words and dealings throughout a good portion of the movie. Plus the action with Russel and his small team of bank robbers taking on the police SWAT teams is enough to satisfy anyone's taste of gunfights. The ending of the movie is really superb, at least it was to me, and I definately recommend seeing this from start to finish to enjoy it even more.<br /><br />Extras include:<br /><br />Commentary by Spike Lee<br /><br />The Making of Inside Man<br /><br />Featurette #4 - Spike Lee and Denzel Washington discuss their collaborations of the movie<br /><br />More than 25 minutes [that's a lot!] of deleted scenes<br /><br />and three different subtitles [English, Spanish, and French]<br /><br />This is one movie that you should see if you want to see a suspenseful, action thriller that has as much action as it does great acting, and it has a great cast for acting. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>This tightly crafted thriller directed by Spike Lee kept my husband and me enthralled from beginning to end. Denzel Washington is one of my favorites, and here he plays a slightly scruffy, smart, wisecracking detective. He gets off a few great one-liners--in trying to calm down an irate Sikh whose turban is removed by police and screams and yells about discrimination, Washington says "I bet you don't have trouble getting a cab in NYC." A bank is robbed and the burglars disappear--he's just smart enough to be puzzled, rather than simply frustrated.<br /><br />Jodie Foster is marvelous as a shadowy "fixer" of problems--who exactly is she?--we never really know. Clive Owen is the brains behind the operation--and a clever one it is.<br /><br />We only begin to see what must have happened in the last scene or two--the burglars have high motives, and the real "bad guy" is nailed. We left the theatre with heads spinning, only then understanding the clues that had been left along the way. I suppose there were holes--but not so many as to mar this thoroughly enjoyable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I must admit that I just expected another heist film with the detective (Denzel Washington) and the nanck robber (Clive Owen) playing mind games. Sure there's mind games but the movie is still not your usual bank robber wish hostages movie. It's smartly made by director Spike Lee and you never really know where it will go. Plus the performances are just top notch. Clive Owen finally gets a film since Closer where he gets to show how good of an actor he really is.<br /><br />  While of course Denzel is awesome as always as the dective trying to figure out what Owen really wants out of the bank robbery. While Jodie Foster gives a different sort of performance that we're used to from her. Christopher Plummer's "also really good" character owns the bank and hires her to make sure he gets something back that's inside the bank. She knows it must be something either valuable or something he just wants knew one to find out about. So she's really good as women that people go to get things done and she's also always makes it clear that she's nobodys fool.<br /><br />  While William Dafoe (Spiderman) is also in good form as a cop who's ready to take command of the situation if Washington messes up. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Serenity) plays Washington's partner and the two work together well. Ejiofor has proven this year and last last that he's no doubt ready to be a big star. He shows that here too by sharing the screen with Denzel with ease. With the cast so good it helps that the script is so clever, interesting and unpredictable. This film is really a must see!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Spike Lee's `Inside Man' centers around a bank robbery in Manhattan, but if you are looking forward to seeing shoot-outs or explosions, you will be hugely disappointed. Lee's film is not about them; in spite of the hostage situation, it is more like a con-game done between three players - Denzel Washington's police detective, Clive Owen's bank robber, and Jodie Foster's mysterious female who represents the interest of one person.<br /><br />To reveal much about the story will only lessen the fun you will get while watching cleverly constructed `Inside Man.' I only say this; the film deals with a `perfect crime' scenario. At the beginning of the film, in some dark place like a prison cell, one Dalton Russell, Clive Owen's enigmatic mastermind, tells you about his idea about perfect crime. He knows how to do it, and he means it.<br /><br />The film gradually reveals the true meaning of his words, showing how the four robbers led by Dalton hit the bank and take hostage. Denzel Washington's detective Keith Fraizer hurries to the crime scene as hostage negotiator, but he is not the only one who is interested in the situation, as Mayor of NYC also arrives, and strongly suggests that an ace `fixer' Madeleine White (played by delightfully polite and ice-cold Jodie Foster) should remain there and give a `help' or two to solve some problems.<br /><br />[PLOT HOLES] I said the film is `clever,' but that doesn't mean the film's script by first-time writer Russell Gewirtz is free from plot holes. I said clever because it succeeds, almost if not perfectly, in covering up the numerous holes in the implausible plot with a taut storytelling of Lee, and the powerhouse acting from the three leads and the good supports such as Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br /><br />You know, no `clever' robbers would take hostages; in `Inside Man,' however, there is a good reason for the robbers to take hostages, but the reason itself is, if you think about it rationally, highly unlikely. But the film's story remains still entertaining all the same, not by just following the story, but by showing the complexity of the characters. That's why `Inside Man' is most intriguing when it reflects the racial diversity of the city and the country, for example, in the scene where the police get panicky after seeing a man wearing a turban.<br /><br />But the main attraction of `Inside Man' is its skillful storytelling greatly helped by the top-notch cast. Not that the plot is totally unpredictable for some of you will be able to anticipate the twists in the plot. Moreover, we all know that Jodie's Foster's lawyer (or whatever she is) is only possible because of her good acting. We all know that no one is allowed to behave like her while a serious hostage situation is going on. But like any other good films about the perfect crimes, `Inside Man' requires suspension of disbelief, and much of it, and perhaps it is aware of its defect when it briefly refers to the films like `Serpico' and `Dog Day Afternoon' much more realistic version of police and heist in New York. Still `Inside Man is a very entertaining film as long as you can ignore certain elements in its very convoluted story.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>INSIDE MAN opens with a bank robber, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) explaining that he has just robbed a bank.  The who, what, when, where, and why are questions that everyone already knows the answers to.  What people don't know is the how.  The movie then illustrates just how Russell was able to complete his master heist.<br /><br />Russell and his gang begin their caper by entering a premier bank in New York posing as painters.  They shine lights at the cameras, lock the doors, reveal their weapons, and announce that a robbery is in progress.  Confusion mounts as the robbers dress those in the bank in identical costumes.  Along the way, a game of wits is played between Russell and Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington).  Frazier knows Russell is up to something but he just can't figure out what.  Hired into the game by the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), is independent "fixer" Madeline White (Jodie Foster).  White's presence seems unnecessary for most of the movie, but she adds a wild card into the whole scenario that cannot be ignored.  The fun part is trying to figure out just how it's all going to play out in the end and how Russell is able to escape with a fortune, but no stolen money and without being caught.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN has a great cast with some fabulous acting.  Washington, Foster, and Plummer are magnificent as always, but stronger performances are given by some of the film's supporting actors, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor as Frazier's assistant Bill Mitchell and Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh hostage who when released from the bank is at first thought to be a terrorist.<br /><br />For a heist picture, INSIDE MAN moves rather slowly.  Yet, at the slower pace the movie never really drags.  Also, scattered throughout the movie are moments of social commentary-such as when Russell speaks with a young boy in the bank during the heist about the hand held video game he is playing.  Beside the commentary, these moments also provide greater depth to the characters we see on the screen.<br /><br />Overall, INSIDE MAN is an enjoyable heist picture.  It's a movie that a wide audience can relate to.  It isn't Spike Lee's best picture, but it is his most commercial.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I love heist type films. This one kept my interest from the beginning. The end was pretty cool. The cast all did pretty nice jobs and for the most part seemed believable. I've seen it only once but definetly plan to watch it again sometime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Clive Owen plays a bank robber, and i think he is a brilliant one.  He got his hostages, about 30 or so, to strip down to their underwear and put on the same costumes as the robbers, so that when the people are set free, the police think they're the robbers and arrest them.  Clive Owen's character wanted the money to buy a plane. ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>The first thing that attracted me to this film was the cast.  Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer, Jodie Foster, heck Willem Dafoe is really a bit player in this one.  Not to mention that Spike Lee, not one of my favorite directors, but certainly capable of telling a good story, and the potential was there for brilliance.  By now, you know surely that the film deals with a heist of a bank, that the thieves are not after the normal booty that bank robbers go after, and that someone high up in the bank brass stands to lose very personally based on the actions of the thieves.  What you may not know is why the movie is so much fun and so great to see.<br /><br />Clive Owen owns this film.  Yes, Denzel is great and carries his scenes well, but Owen has the task of not only convincingly playing a thief who is totally in control of the situation, he has to play the role in a way to illicit sympathy from the audience.  He does both things masterfully.  No doubt you will be in agreement that his performance is the landmark achievement of the movie and the reason it ultimately works.  Washington is a good two dimensional character, blending his desire to take advantage of this one great chance he has at landing a plum role within the police department and the fact that he is personally struggling with the pressure of his girlfriend who wants to discuss "the M word" and wear something on a certain finger.  In fact, this becomes a large part of the film, right up to the very end.<br /><br />If I noted a couple of weaknesses in the film they would be these.  Jodie Foster's character, while necessary, seems to distract from the action.  Her role is somewhat important, but I wished she had not been there.  Also, the film wraps up somewhat clumsily, as it feels that an extra scene or two should have been left out.  This would have made the scenes after the main action feel much tighter.  The very end of the film was the only time I felt any urge to look at my watch.<br /><br />These are minor complaints, believe me.  In the end, this is a winner, top to bottom.  The scary thing about watching movies like this is that the idea the crooks had for robbing the bank is so smart, it will be a wonder if other people don't try it.  The heist strategy made that much sense.  I highly recommend this film.  You won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>The one note about Spike Lee films is that you're never sure what you're going to get. I'm not really a fan, I find that his films are too convoluted with extraneous detail and somewhat over produced. Inside Man retains all the elements of a solid bank robbery/caper film, whilst also giving us Spike Lee's trademark of gritty, street-wise irreverence.<br /><br />The problem with Inside Man is that it's impossibly unbelievable with a plot that strains the realms of credibility; combine this with it's over-long running time and you have a film that features some great performances by it's cast - Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster - but ultimately sags a bit in the middle and ends up becoming rather ponderous.<br /><br />Lee manages to pull off a handful of effective scenes, but he doesn't have the flair to bring the whole movie off with real conviction. An enigmatic master criminal (Owen) - who spends most of the movie wearing a mask - plans and executes a "genius plan" in which he and several masked companions take over a Lower Manhattan bank and brutally seize several dozen of its customers as hostages.<br /><br />The NYPD negotiator given the task of dealing with these crooks is an affable junior detective, Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) - under a cloud of suspicion from a previous case - he soon surmises that the perpetrators don't actually want the bank's money. Enter smarmy and elegant New York political insider Madeline White (Foster) who knows everybody and even has the ear of the Mayor.<br /><br />Madeline is hired by the chairman of the bank's board of directors (Plummer) to oversee the crisis and make sure that certain secrets he has in his safe-deposit box stay secret. The bulk of the film involves the standoff between the bank robbers and the NYPD as they try frantically to ensure that the hostages remain safe.<br /><br />Of course we know the hostages survive because Lee inserts interview footage of them after the heist is over, this device, however, tips off the outcome, dissipates suspense and quickly becomes tiresome. This is just one of the many techniques Lee uses to clutter the movie's structure and prevent the plot from unfolding as quickly as it should.<br /><br /> Obviously, everyone has something to hide, particularly the bank president, but when his past is revealed, it finally appears with a bit of a thud, with the movie going through to much difficulty to arrive at very little. In all fairness, Inside Man has some interesting things to say about race, money, power and the ethics of urban living, particularly in New York and the performances are wonderfully cynical and gritty.<br /><br />Washington is sexy and strong, Foster is skillfully odious as the icy, sophisticated and amoral Madeline who cares for nothing but chasing big bucks, Owen is morbidly compelling as the determined heavy and Plummer is letter-perfect as the guilt-ridden bank honcho.<br /><br />Lee, however, just doesn't seem able to bring all the disparate elements of a heist film into a convincing and gratifying whole and in the end; the movie is vaguely unsatisfying and impossibly far-fetched. Mike Leonard August 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Spike Lee has never been on my top list of directors. His movies usually have very strong social commentaries, and nothing more than that. Those social commentaries though are usually the same thing, and it always has to deal with race. Hell, he calls every one of his films "A Spike Lee Joint". I'm not against it, but it usually detracts from the story. Inside Man is really his first movie that really focuses on the narrative and is intent on telling an entertaining story. The film is his most mainstream film to date, and in my opinion is his best. Clive Owen plays a bank robber who decides to go Dog Day Afternoon style and perform an elaborate bank heist, but this theif has everything planned to perfection. The film opens right into the action and wastes no time. Denzel Washington plays the "average joe" hostage negotiator who is assigned to the case, and Chiwetel Ejiofor plays his partner. As the story progresses we learn more of what the true purpose of this bank heist is. The owner of the bank, played by Christopher Plummer, has a secret about his past that could destroy his repuation if released to the public and it happens to be located in an unlisted safety deposit box in that bank. He hires Jodie Foster to help him try and reason with Clive Owen's character, while all Denzel Washington is concerned about is serving justice. The film is quick, superbly edited, and extremely entertaining. Spike Lee doesn't compromise his techniques and the film still retains all of the familiar Lee social commentaries. Race and politics become the underlaying theme for the film and it moves it in the right direction. All the reviews and ads talk about the twist ending and a plot full of surprises. It's not that kind of movie, there isn't a Shyamalan twist waiting at the end of the movie, but there are a few secrets about the characters that are slowly revealed throughout. There are some surprises that will make you grin with shame becaue you didn't see them coming, and those are always fun. The racial and political theme is not overpowering, it's not what drives the film but rather enhances the character relations in the film. It's a really well put together piece of filmmaking. Sharp dialogue, light tone, and great entertainment make Inside Man a joint worth passing to the next person.<br /><br />ACTING: This is the dream cast that any director would kill for. Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Willem Dafoe headline this impressive ensamble. I mean, how can you have bad acting with a cast like this? It's impossible. The cast is so experienced that they make it look easy to pull off roles like these. The characters feel natural and real, and are emotionally involving. It's a great cast.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Spike Lee proves himself to be a great storyteller. He focuses on the important things and highlights them with his personal touches. He even has his trademark "floaty camera" technique, which he uses to show determination on Denzel Washington's character's part. Even the opening titles and credits are done with style. He uses a very catchy song for the opening and closing credits that sets the perfect tone for the film. It's a song from Bollywood composer, A.R. Rahman. It's titled "Chayya Chayya". You can find the album on Amazon, it's the soundtrack to Dil Se. Inside Man is a tightly woven piece of filmmaking, and is worth your time</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>For about an hour and 45 minutes, Inside Man had me on the edge of my seat, totally clueless as to what was going on and how the film was going to be resolved.  But then, when the ending finally happened, I found myself to be pretty disappointed.  Not disappointed in the film overall, but just at how Spike Lee decided to wrap it up.<br /><br />The plot is really simple:  Dalton Russell, played brilliantly (as always) by Clive Owen, has devised "the perfect bank robbery," which he is executing in a branch of the bank in the middle of New York City.  Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is called on the scene as the head negotiator, and proceeds to delve into a cat-and-mouse game with Dalton.  The situation is further complicated when Jodie Foster, who plays an unexplained, extremely influential woman, comes onto the scene demanding to be given access to the robbers and to the bank itself.  Foster's character is the one part of the movie that just doesn't seem to fit.  We know why she is there, but her character is not developed at all.  We don't know why she does what she does, how she got to this point, or why she is so ridiculously confident about getting her way.<br /><br />Other than Foster's character, we pretty much know exactly the kind of person we are dealing with when it comes to Russell, Frazier, and the other important roles.  While the film does a great job of infusing the racial issue with the routine bank heist storyline, the film ultimately trips over its own feet.  A film with this much build up, and when the build up is this well done, needs to absolutely blow the viewer away with the ending, or the whole film seems to be for naught.  When the ending comes, I was left thinking, "is this really why the robbers went to all this trouble?"  There are some minor plot holes, but the film does explain itself, just not to the extent that I was expecting or hoping for.  This is the best Spike Lee film that I have ever seen, but that really isn't saying that much...<br /><br />Inside Man definitely gets my recommendation, but be forewarned that the film ultimately can't live up to its own cleverness.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Renegade director Spike Lee and actor Denzel Washington (MO' BETTER BLUES, MALCOLM X, HE GOT GAME) team up for the fourth time in this absorbing and byzantine caper film. Denzel plays Police Detective Keith Frazier, toiling in the Hostage Negotiation Team, who, along with his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), gets assigned to a daytime robbery at the Manhattan Trust Bank which had escalated into a hostage situation. But, with a cerebral criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who seems to have thought of every contingency and is always one step ahead of the law and, also, with the involvement of a mysterious female civilian negotiatior (Jodie Foster), things get very murky indeed.<br /><br />As usual with these types of films, there are layers of complexity woven into the plot. Nagging questions surface thru the course of the film which perplex the viewer. Why does the leader of the robber gang seem to be stalling? Why is the elderly chairman of the bank's Board of Director (Christopher Plummer) so invested in the goings-on? What exactly is Jodie Foster's character up to? Why do the robbers dig a hole in the storeroom? And, because this is a Spike Lee joint, there are several scene interjections of social and racial relevance. Let's face it, we're living in the post 9/11 era and Lee's sequence of the "Arab's" treatment by the police, in particular, underscores that plainly.<br /><br />The magnetic Denzel Washington is again superb (but, really, when does the guy ever suck?). He always brings to his role an aura of cool assuredness and a certain stylish bravura. His smile, as usual, when directed at potential perpetrators, contains a biting intensity. Clive Owen is equally very good as the self-contained and calculated villain of the story, somehow becoming sympathetic enough that you sort of root for him. His opening lines, as he breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the viewer, makes him an instantly intriguing figure. Jodie Foster doesn't do as well in her nebulous role of a smirky, high-powered transactionist but she does do enough, acting-wise, to rouse the audience's curiousity. I do feel, however, that Chiwetel Ejiofor's talent is wasted here as he isn't given enough script with which to get his hands dirty.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN isn't exactly set at a breaknecked pace. It's a contemplative feature film, a thinking man's thriller with very few action set pieces, though tension is maintained and remains palpable throughout. The movie's main selling point is the cast, who makes the most out of this twisty caper premise. This complement of actors has got to be Spike Lee's most star powered group yet. Now, the ending might leave a few audiences disgruntled for not having enough "punch" but it's perfectly in line with the cerebral tone of the movie.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN proves the versatility of Spike Lee as a director as, this time out, he tackles a suspense film and does a more than adequate job. Once again, Spike ventures into slice-of-life, character-driven interplays, even giving his lesser actors time to briefly shine in the spotlight. There is one sequence - wherein the sergeant first on the crime scene reveals his casual racial prejudices to Detective Frazier - that I thought particularly effective. One of my favorite moments in the film is the scene wherein the police, after having solved a puzzle postured by the heist ringleader, continue to humorously argue about the details of the puzzle. And, then there's the prim-looking white guy whose cell's ring tone is Kanye West's "Golddigger." Anyway, if you don't mind sitting thru a film over two hours long - a film which, by the way, might require more than one viewing - and consulting your brain cells throughout its screening, then INSIDE MAN is for you. Plus, that Indian song, "Chaiyya Chaiyya," is kinda slamming.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>Spike Lee has created an imaginative and gripping thriller with "Inside Man". Collecting some of the biggest names on screen, Lee has put together a film that has both the thrills and twists to entertain, and the comments on society to give something more when the credits have rolled by.<br /><br />Set in New York, the viewer enters the world of Dalton Russell, a bank robber with a so-called "perfect plan", and Detective Keith Frazier, who arrives to negotiate with the team of robbers. Add in the sub-plots of Arthur Case, who has a lot to lose in this robbery, and Madeleine White, a type of "discrete" agent with some less than legal influence, and you have a complex story line that gives you enough to think about to cope with a couple of viewings.<br /><br />The names filling the credits are impressive, making the movie all the more enjoyable. Jodie Foster, (White), Denzel Washington, (Frazier), Clive Owen, (Russell, a surprisingly good bad guy!), Christopher Plummer, (Case, and Willem Dafoe all make this movie special in their own ways. They are all top grade actors with the skills to make the story live.<br /><br />The social commentary is present all through the film at varying levels. For the most part, it is a subtle presence in the background, hardly making itself felt, but there none-the-less. At other moments, it is much more obvious. My own favourite scene is one betweem Dalton Russell and Brian, the young boy with his Playstation Portable and the violent games. Dalton asks about the game in which one has to do things such as kill and destroy people, (extremely graphically). Russell promises to have a word with Brian's father about the game. The entire movie is saturated with a social commentary on the corruption and violence that surrounds us, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />This is one of the best films I have seen recently and is a movie that has given me lots to think about and consider. It is powerful in its twists, well-acted and very well executed in all aspects. It is thoroughly enjoyable on a number of different levels. A great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I borrowed this from my local blockbuster, on Tuesday Launch day, August 8th!

We start with a prisoner, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), who is a bit of a Riddler in terrorist clothing.

Generously, he offers it's a trick question.)  We're not sure what he wants, but he tells us his purpose is to rob a bank "because he can".  After that, the narrative is replaced by his actions to do just that at Manhattan's Bank and Trust.  He has quite a crew and set up as he and his cohorts enter disguised as painters.  Cleverly they knock out the cameras with infra red lights.  After terrorizing the people, he takes their cell phones, has them disrobe and makes them dress in terrorist garb, like their own.  The police in a daring rescue or capturing them upon release don't know the victims from the villains.  All the bugging is trumped in one way or another.  Just when you think the situation is thick enough, the bank executives come into the fray.  It turns out the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and his close associate, Ms. White (played with steely cool by Jody Foster) have a stake in Dalton's game.  The president has a sensitive secret which Dalton can exploit, so, while the hostage taker may not seem to be playing with a full deck, he is indeed working with a full hand.<br /><br />Intriguing through much and entertaining throughout, 'Inside Man' often is played like an inside joke, one caper that we can easily follow along.  Denzel Washington has some great, witty lines that are usually associated with James Bond or roles Bruce Willis plays.  Fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Spike Lee was once "the Great White Hope."  American liberal intellectuals were ready to lionize a young black filmmaker qualified to "speak" for black America.  And he tried.  Regrettably, movies like She's Gotta Have It, Do The Right Thing, School Daze, and Jungle Fever - though interesting as only worthy failures can be, were so self-congratulatory and preachy that they resembled A/V Op-Ed pieces more than movies.<br /><br />Powered by a great true story and towering performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee did hit it out of the park once, with Malcolm X, since then it's been a pretty bleak season for the alleged vunderkind.<br /><br />With the Inside Man, Lee ventures into uncharted territory - an exciting, action picture with an interesting psychological twist.  To say he fails is to say the Germans lost WWII.  This failure is made even more remarkable considering how much help he has.  As with Malcolm X, the budget is lavish - this is a dressy film to watch.  Marquee talent is everywhere, Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, even Jodie Foster.  With talent like this, only an idiot could go wrong, right?  But Lee is a very special idiot, and he manages.<br /><br />Despite all the hoopla, this is a one-gadget movie, and by the time it arrives you'll be wondering if Reno 911 is on.  Not since the days of Marcel Marceau has anyone does less with less.  Christopher Plummer looks great and gives a splendid performance, but unless his character became a bank president at 12, the entire premise of the movie is blown.  Without that, the logic, motivation, and righteous indignation required to give this film any credibility at all are gone.<br /><br />The turgid pace of this anti-thriller gives Lee plenty of time to indulge in the sort of simplistic, heavy-handed lecturing for which he is known ad nauseum.  A little boy and his video game, "never forget" wall posters, a man and his turban, even breast size, all provide opportunities for Lee to beat his audience in the face.<br /><br />Of all this film's shortcomings, the complete squandering of Jodie Foster is most puzzling.  One imagines she doesn't work for free, and yet her character floats in and out of the action completely unexplained.  Washington makes the most of a bad situation, and Clive Owen, an exceptional actor, tries hard to carry the freight.  Unfortunately, there is no freight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The movie runs a little bit too long, has no real purpose for Jodie Foster, and tries to pass off Christopher Plummer's character as someone who had influence during the Holocaust (assuming he was 35 in 1945, which is still a bit young to be running a bank, that makes him 96 in 2006), but avoids many of the pratfalls of similar heist movies and emerges as a watchable thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Master director Spike Lee (who for some reason gets completely ignored by the oscars) is back at it again - this time with a seemless suspense film.<br /><br />Denzel is great as always, and the supporting cast is marvelous.. This is not even close to being one of Spike's best, it is a little too reminiscent of other classic noir thrillers, but it is done with a masterful touch - not to be missed..</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Inside Man is nothing without this amazing cast and without Denzel Washington leading them off it would have been ugly. Without the cast the movie is a bit predictable so it's no wonder why Denzel and Clive were in this one.  Inside Man is about a bank robbery, then the rich man that owns the bank needs to get in there to get something that he wants to keep secret, this is a story that so far has low interest in it cause if someone like Peter Richards or Mike Justice were the leading actors no one would care about this movie. It gets better though when the plot thickens cause you don't exactly know what Clive and his buddies are there for, they don't want money. The tactics the robbers are using have never been seen before, like dressing all the hostages up in the same exact clothes as the robbers so the cops don't know who's who.<br /><br />So now you've got a raging Denzel who has to find a way to save more hostages especially when he sees one killed on camera and calm, cool, and relaxed Clive because he has everyone in the palm of his hands. The end of this movie isn't shocking but it's pretty darn good and it actually helps everyone get what they want. There's not much to say about Inside Man except amazing directing by Spike, amazing acting from everybody and a job well done on taking a mediocre script and turning it into something more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>Despite a capable cast and a clever premise, "Inside Man" didn't quite work for me.  Like "The Usual Suspects" (a far better movie, IMHO) "Inside Man' relies on a chopped-up timeline and after-the-fact interviews to divert your attention from the fact that, basically, the story it tells isn't really very plausible.  How does the leader of the "robbers" know about the damning evidence in the safe deposit box? How does Case know that THEY know? And aren't we past the time when former Nazi collaborators make convincing villains? Case must be at least 85!  When do we stop?  When they're 100, or 110?  Get some new bad guys, Hollywood!  3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>There are movies that don't want to end.  You think the credits should be running anytime now, but no.  The movie keeps throwing "ending" after "ending" at you until you're just ready for it to be over with.  Inside Man is one of these movies.<br /><br />There are some good even great things going on in Inside Man.  As a character and genre study, its amazing.  Screenwriter Russell Gewirtz has fun with the heist film cliches, by creating a situation that's unknown to the viewers until close to the end, and then building a heist film around it.  There is a motive here, hidden and entirely secret that stretches beyond a mere bank robbery much like this film is more than about a heist.  Half of the film's fun comes from confusion and trying to ascertain why the heist is happening, what's going through Clive Owen's Dalton Russell's head.<br /><br />As a character study, it's also interesting.  Not one of the main characters has morals.  Each character has a motive, a desire and not one of them is pristine.  Its nice after seeing her in two women in distress films, that Jodi Foster can bring the cold-hearted and calculated feelings to her character.  The characters are morally ambivalent and, while it can be considered a jaded view of society, but it was interesting seeing conflicted characters who might not be interested in what's right or wrong, but what's good for them.  It might be jaded, but it also is in some ways a good representation of how some things work.<br /><br />Of course there were some indications that this is a Spike Lee film.  Some of his critiques on society are spot on and humorous.  I did take offense with the very minor, but definitely frustrating poke at video games.  Very minor in the film and has nothing to do with it that I hate to bring it up.  But the implication that even these morally ambivalent characters have a problem with a video game (not even an actual game, by the way) was frustrating to me.  Others seemed timely, but stretched.  As an example, the Arab who's really a Sheik and the police saying something to the effect "Oh my God he's Arab!" seemed strained.  Timely, interesting, yes, but seemed stilted.<br /><br />Spike Lee also does a great job of introducing minor characters that really help to flesh out the story and provide a backdrop for what's happening.  For instance, the cop who comes on the scene in the beginning and his story of when he first had a gun shoved in his face is interesting.  Needless, maybe, but interesting.  Its just unfortunate that at times, Lee seems more interested in pursuing these little details instead of keeping the film moving.<br /><br />At any rate, its an interesting film that gets bogged down toward the end.  Pacing issues aside, it is a good film that turns some heist conventions on its head while presenting jaded characters who each have a motive and who are very human and real.  It would have been better, though, with a litter tighter script that didn't have to explain every little thing at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>With Inside Man Spike Lee certainly managed to disguise a regular bankjob story as a flashy accelerating action movie.<br />Nevertheless the result he came up with is still worth watching.<br />The New York police has trapped a small group of bankrobbers led by Clive Owen inside the bank they were trying to rob. Denzel Washington is in charge of the police squad sieging the bank. As time passes by he begins to realize, that the robbers aren't the type of criminals they pretend to be. Spike Lee is still a great director, but Inside Man clearly tries to be too many things at the same time. There a too many subplots in there , that could have easily been removed from the final cut. Shame though...because the cast is great...even Jodie Foster is fun to watch for a change. Normally she tends to play women that could burst out crying at any time.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>I was entertained by this movie....up until the end. It had suspense, action and an enigma at the heart of the movie. It was a bank robbery movie - or was it? What kept me riveted were the performances of the central actors - Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, etc....as well as the various moral ambiguities and twists and turns.<br /><br />  It was not, however, totally plausable and for that reason I have to give it a less than stellar rating. Without giving too much away, I can only say that I found the central premise to be a bit hackneyed and the ending, such as it was, left too many loose ends.<br /><br />  However, I HIGHLY recommend getting the DVD, if only because the bonus features are wonderful. There is an interview with Spike Lee and Denzel Washinton, a kind of retrospective of the movies they've made together, the challenges, the experiences they went through. THat was fascinating to view.<br /><br />  Also, Spike Lee's commentary (if you choose that option) is also well worth hearing. He is a brilliant filmaker and his insights about how he composed various shots, how he envisioned this film, etc....offer much to budding scriptwriters, film students, actors or people who simply like to watch movies, even if they never want to be a part of a film crew.<br /><br />  The film itself, however, left something to be desired, at least for me. Would I watch it again? In a heartbeat but only for the pleasure of watching the actors and actresses in this one. The plot would not be the main draw.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />Spike Lee's "Inside Man" is probably the most commercially viable and least cutting-edge film the maverick director has ever made.  I wouldn't exactly call it a sellout - Lee is as entitled as anyone else to make money off his projects - but it is a bit disheartening seeing Lee aiming his sights and his estimable talents as low as he has here.<br /><br />"Inside Man" starts out like a dozen other bank robbery tales, with a gang of masked gunmen storming into the establishment and turning the terrified customers and employees into ready-made hostages, then hunkering down for a prolonged standoff with the law enforcement officials outside.  Denzel Washington plays the hostage negotiator whose job it is to bring the perpetrators to justice with a minimal loss of innocent life.<br /><br />The movie deserves credit for bringing a few novel twists to the storyline, but, frankly, most of what happens in this film simply defies credibility.  We don't believe for a moment the goings-on here. Despite a "surprise" ending and a plethora of Lee's trademark cinematic flourishes, we leave the movie shrugging our shoulders uttering, "Is that all there is?"<br /><br />Washington does the best he can with a halfheartedly written character, but Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe and the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer aren't given much to do in their various roles.  Only Jodie Foster - playing a ruthless real estate agent inexplicably brought in to assist in the case - seems to be having any fun at all with the film.  She brings a much needed note of high-spirited camp to a movie that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.<br /><br />"Dog Day Afternoon" this ain't.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This is an attempt at sophistication that just doesn't hack it.  Jodie Foster's character, for one example, is so pretentious and obnoxious that one is tempted to reach into the screen and slap her face.<br /><br />The language that everyone uses, particularly the Mayor, is so full of obscenities that it is just not credible.  Filthy language for the sake of filthy language is just filthy.<br /><br />The story, where Denzel Washington's character appears to finally understand what is going on with the bank robbers, is just too obscure and nonsensical for anyone to figure out, even Denzel Washington.<br /><br />If there is some kind of message her, like criminals will finally be found out and will receive justice, it is lost in the juvenile way in which this movie is presented.  Just plain awful.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>I know this movie won't be shown at the boys and girls club!

The English audio was a bit distorted, no subtitles, and I'm sorry to report that Mr Washington developed a case of high-speed mumbles here. And, after all, it is only a bank hostage movie. Hard to care. Sorry folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Spike Lee is the last filmmaker you'd imagine making a slick heist film for a major studio and yet that is exactly what he's done with Inside Man, a cleverly staged and executed thriller. What's even more incredible is that this intricately plotted movie was written by first timer Russell Gewirtz. Lee fans worried that he's sold out can rest assured that even though the filmmaker is working for a studio this is hardly your average director-for-hire gig. And, as if to reassure his fans, Lee has teamed up with Denzel Washington again - always a good sign as they work so well together (this being their fourth collaboration).<br /><br />Washington plays a smooth talking smart guy who is trying to figure out what the bank robbers, in particular Russell, are up to while dealing with influential bureaucrats, like White, breathing down his neck. He displays the ease and confidence of an actor in top form and is wonderful, as always, to watch. Clive Owen is also very good as the ruthless bank robber with a keen intellect. Is he messing with the cops? Is he following some sort of ingenious master plan? Both? It's an interesting role for the actor as he spends a good chunk of the movie with his marquee good looks obscured by a mask.<br /><br />One of the joys of watching Inside Man is seeing all of these A-listers interact with each other; all under Lee's expert direction. The plotting is complex and brilliant as Gewirtz puts a new spin on the "perfect crime" while also paying homage to other heist movies like Dog Day Afternoon and Quick Change. Best of all, like The Usual Suspects, he ends the film with a delicious twist that is extremely hard to predict. Inside Man is a solid, thoroughly entertaining thriller with a brain - a rarity in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />There are five deleted scenes that include more footage of Frazier and Mitchell interrogating the hostages and how they perceived what went down. There is also an amusing scene where Frazier and Mitchell discuss the meaning behind a Bob Marley song and also a collection of local news reports on the bank heist.<br /><br />"The Making of Inside Man" is a pleasant notch above the usual electronic press kit material. Producer Brian Grazer provided the director a way to work successfully with a studio, which he hadn't done for some time. Also included are excerpts from a cast script read-through and rehearsals that sheds a little light on the creative process.<br /><br />In what is quite possibly the most enjoyable extra on this disc, "Number 4" is a lively conversation between Lee and Washington about the four films they've done together. You can tell that they're good friends by the way they joke with each other in a relaxed manner. This is a fun, engaging extra.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Spike Lee. For a director it's all about making choices and Lee talks about particular shots in the movie and why he chose them. He speaks fondly of the cast without being to sycophantic about it. This isn't the chattiest track ever recorded but Lee talks enough to make it worth a listen if you're a fan of the man and his movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I watched this movie through twice, and then a third time with director Spike Lee's commentary. And I still don't quite get it. It seems to be a table full of pieces that just don't fit together.<br /><br />For example, what was Jodi Foster doing in this movie? What did her character accomplish? What did Christopher Plummer get, or think he had gotten, when he handed that check over to her? She doesn't seem to perform any function here, other than to cut a fine female figure.<br /><br />It seems we have a lot of A-List stars strutting their stuff, in search of a logical script. Denzel Washington basically reprises his role as Malcolm X. Well, he's a hostage negotiator here rather than a civil rights leader. But he stands and delivers with the same quick, snappy patter. He strides down the street with the same confident air, right down to the way he shears the brim of his hat jauntily into place.<br /><br />Jodi Foster may uncharacteristically play a character of dubious morality in this film. But she tackles her assignment with characteristic intelligence and command. In the same way, most of the actors are playing to type, and do not stretch beyond their usual projections. They all meet in the arena of this bank hesit in the personas we have come to associate with them. But these good actors don't form an ensemble. They aren't given a logical reason for occupying the same screen space.<br /><br />I said that this movie was like a jigsaw puzzle with some pieces missing. Actually, it's worse. The pieces we have are colorful shards that form some interesting patterns as they twist and turn. But they ultimately seem to come from several different pictures altogether.<br /><br />The whole movie is like its concluding music. As the closing credits roll, we hear a rap song juxtaposed against a Bollywood ditty that I guarantee you won't be able to get out of your head. They are both good pieces of music. But they have no logical reason for being stuck together here - other than the fact that they both must have struck Spike Lee's fancy.<br /><br />So ultimately this is a pack rat's nest of shiny baubles drawn from different places. Still, it's good to look at.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Director Spike Lee hits box-office gold with a New York heist thriller that never lapses into cliche.

The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.<br /><br />A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time?<br /><br />The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.<br /><br />Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific. A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge  is just one of many ornaments to this well-made film. The writing and the plot are believable -- and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies. The final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film.<br /><br />Other than the pace of the film -- which mimics the wait-and-see pace of real negotiations (but is slow to the point of torpor) -- "Inside Man" is brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I have said it before, and it remains true: I enjoy every second when I see Denzel Washington on the screen.  He is about as engaging an actor as there is.  Yet he keeps each character fresh and different.  True, I enjoy some performances more than others and some of the films he is in I can't even work myself up to seeing.  But when I do, he is always most engaging.  This is a movie I would not have watched except that he is in it.  I had heard less than enthusiastic things about it, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if Denzel is in it, well, it has to have some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />So, how was it?  Well, while I was watching it I was quite engaged.  The actors are all very good and give more than fine performances.  And I think Spike Lee has done a terrific job in putting this film together.  After it is over, and you think back on aspects of the plot, which I will not go into here, because you shouldn't know any more going in than it is a bank robbery, you will realize that Lee has pulled a big rabbit out of a very small hat.<br /><br />I have already said that Denzel's performance as Det. Keith Frazier is terrific.  His partner, Det. Bill Mitchell is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, whom I first noticed as "The Operative" in "Serenity".  He is just as engaging here in a vastly different role.  Jodie Foster is another of my favorites, and she does very well with what she is given here.  But here role here is more like the function of a magician's assistant than a protagonist.  Her character, Madeline White, allows the paranoids in the audience to believe this is how the broader culture actually works and White allows certain points of exposition to happen rather than having any real payoff.  I am saying that I still love Jodie Foster, but this role was a dud DESPITE her fine acting.<br /><br />Arthur Case, played by the great Christopher Plummer, is not quite believable because he would have to be about twenty years older than Plummer is and would have to have made some decades long very stupid choices for no explicable reasons in order for this plot to work.  Clive Owen is the other main character, Dalton Russell.  He has a hard job because in most of the movie his face and body are mostly covered.  I still don't know how Owen's character learned enough to target what he was after in this movie.  If he had discovered the materials and objects by accident, that would have been different.  But the plot has him going only after these items.  We can project motives on him afterwards, but I don't recall the movie making clear how he gained the intelligence and what his motivation actually was for such a difficult and risky crime.<br /><br />Anyway, a decent heist film while you watch it.  I just don't recommend thinking about it too much along the way or afterwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It's good to see filmmaker Spike Lee come back to form with this highly entertaining popcorn movie that transcends the tense hostage crisis portrayed with a clever plot of psychological gamesmanship and duplicity. At first, the film feels like it's going to be a new millennium update of Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic, "Dog Day Afternoon", complete with Terence Blanchard's jazzy, 1970's-sounding score. Lee, however, spices the story with his own sensibilities around urban survival and post-9/11 racial tensions, and the movie benefits greatly from the perspective of a director not known for such predictable genre pictures. While it runs a bit long at 129 minutes, there is so much zigzag to the proceedings that the length is forgivable.<br /><br />Impressively written by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz, the plot meticulously unfolds on a precise, need-to-know basis as it focuses on the mano-a-mano game between coolly confident criminal Dalton Russell and cynical NYPD detective Keith Frazier after Russell and his crew hold up a Lower Manhattan bank and keep fifty hostages at gunpoint. This is no standard good-versus-evil melodrama, as Gewirtz and Lee give both characters a lot of intriguing texture which make them fascinating adversaries in an unlikely search for a common bond.  Audaciously, Lee chooses not to spotlight so much on the suspense elements of the tense situation at hand since the movie includes flash-forward interviews with freed hostages. Rather, the film is far more involved with the characters' motivations and what they are willing to do to move toward resolution.<br /><br />An additional wrinkle is the bank chairman Arthur Case, who is worried about securing the confidential contents of his safe-deposit box once the robbery is underway. At this point, he hires Madeline White, a coolly calculating, designer-outfitted power broker willing to negotiate with Russell to get the box. How all four characters dance around each other is the primary pleasure to be derived from the movie, as one keeps guessing what each will do to get to his or her objective. Moreover, Lee's trademark touches are everywhere from the unexpected sparks of comedy - some piercing in their political incorrectness but no less funny - to the artificial backward zooms that make characters look like they are on conveyor belts to the idiosyncratic behavior of the hostages.<br /><br />Casting is just about ideal here. It's no surprise that longtime Lee muse Denzel Washington is terrific as Frazier, showing the character's flaws, ambition and moxie with maximum fluency. Clive Owen has the most cryptic role as Russell, but he manages to exude supreme confidence and a conflicted conscience with minimal fuss. Leave it to Lee to capitalize on Jodie Foster's inherently chilly intellect and subvert it to make the patronizing White a curiously ambiguous and utterly fascinating figure. There is nice supporting work by Christopher Plummer expertly shifting between benign and treacherous as Case, Willem Dafoe surprisingly non-villainous as the head of the SWAT Team, and especially British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor a completely convincing New Yorker as Frazier's enthusiastic partner. There is a nice twist at the end, but Gewirtz's script makes it satisfying within the context of the entire plot. This is a deft, character-driven thriller most welcome during the typical late winter/early spring movie-going doldrums.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Everything about INSIDE MAN makes the viewer want to love this film: Spike Lee as director, a stunning cast, a good musical score that sounds a bit like Bollywood music, a theme that invites social comment.<br /><br />For this viewer the terrific ingredients do not add up to a unique suspense thriller of a film. The story is a variation of hundreds of other films (writer Russell Gewirtz somehow got away with just an outline of a script of holes) and the technique of telling the story - interspersing post incident interviews with the people involved in the caper - makes it thud along.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is his usual fine acting self, playing a cop with his own demons. Chiwetel Ejiofor is solid as his partner. Clive Owen spends the better part of the film behind a mask but continues his reputation for quiet and powerful characterizations as the bank robber. Christopher Plummer is convincing as the back president with secrets to hide, which Jodie Foster as a middle-woman manages to manipulate. Willem Defoe is fine as the cop in charge. They all perform well in roles they could do in their sleep.<br /><br />Clocking in at over two hours the film seems to dawdle over some inconsequential details in an attempt to camouflage the holes in the script. Spike Lee makes it work because of his style. But in the end the story isn't involving enough to hold our attention ('been there, done that') and this viewer, for one, fell asleep during portions when the film slowed for unknown reasons. Love the director and the actors, pass on the film. Grady Harp, August 06</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>The 2006 movie "Inside Man" would appear to have a lot going for it: a tense plot built around a hostage situation in a New York City bank, a handful of first rate actors, and an accomplished director with a real feel for his native city.  However, this movie might be too clever for its own good.<br /><br />The movie opens with a bank heist that gets interrupted by the police, turning into a hostage situation.  NYPD Detective Frazer (Denzel Washington) gets tagged to be the on-scene negotiator, and runs into trouble dealing with a senior uniformed cop (Willem Dafoe), the leader of the heist crew (Clive Owen), and a high-level New York City fixer (Jodie Foster in serious high heels) dispatched by the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer).  Frazer patiently works the hostage problem while increasingly becoming aware that he is being played.<br /><br />This movie is strongest in its presentation of "how things get done" in NYC, with overtones of racial prejudice, official corruption, and deal-making everywhere.  Every principal character is potentially flawed in his or her motivations.  Meanwhile, the tension builds relentlessly toward a crisis point in the hostage negotiations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie undermines its own suspense by telling the story backwards and forwards; the audience knows early on who survives.  The secret at the heart of an admittedly clever heist plot is poorly handled, leading to an ending without much fizz.  The movie's moral punch line is muddied by all the deal-making, including by the supposed good guys.  "Inside Man" isn't a bad movie; it just isn't all it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This film feels off when you compare it to the other films given to us by Spike Lee.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing (we all know that I am not the biggest Spike Lee fan) but the fact that it doesn't truly feel like a Spike Lee film is significant.  Sure, Lee inserts his views on race relations when he has the chance (please get off it for once) but the brisk pace and overall plot development feel like something far removed from director Spike Lee.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing to the viewer is entirely up to that individual.<br /><br />Personally I found the pacing a welcomed change.  It was easier to follow and more engaging than some of Lee's more preachy endeavors, and while it lacks the depth and pristine command that Lee exhibited in `25th Hour' it manages to keep my interest throughout.<br /><br />I was entertained.<br /><br />At the films open we are introduced to Dalton Russell.  Pay close attention for he chooses his words carefully.  He basically tells you all the films secrets in the opening scene, but you won't get it, at least not yet.  He is going to rob a bank.  Next thing you know the bank is sealed and Dalton and his accomplices take everyone hostage, making them don jumpsuits and stripping them of their cell phones and keys.  Outside the bank Detective Keith Frazier (in search of a promotion) takes on the task of negotiating the safety of the hostages with Dalton, but there is no outsmarting that man who has no doubt thought this through.<br /><br />Sadly, it feels at times like the screenwriter didn't do the same.  There are plot holes that stick out like sore thumbs, especially as the plot twists start revealing themselves.  The side plot involving Arthur Case (the bank owner) and the `fixer' he hires is a tad convoluted and needed a little tweaking.  Parts of the execution regarding Dalton's escape are also a bit of a stretch, but it's nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Just don't think about it too hard.<br /><br />The performances are a delight here though.  Clive Owen is a very effective actor who has consistently presented himself wonderfully on screen.  He's able to engage the audience from the moment he opens his mouth (that voice) but he also has the ability to sustain our attention with the light in his eyes.  Denzel Washington was a nice surprise here as well.  He was able to keep his charm controlled as apposed to allowing it to run wild as he often does.  This is probably one of his better performances, for he found the proper balance in his style of acting.  Christopher Plummer does what he can with his character, and he does it very well; but he is upstaged (as is everyone) by Jodie Foster.  Seriously, what in the world has she been doing?  Where was this amazing and commanding force back when she was winning Oscars for performances that were beneath her obviously?  I mean what she does here is leagues ahead of a lot of her more acclaimed performances.<br /><br />LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />In the end `Inside Man' is a very interesting and enjoyable heist film.  It is not as smart as it appears to be, nor as intelligent as it wants to be, but it is as fun as it claims to be so check it out.  The performances and the quick paced action will keep you glued even if the films preposterousness wages war on you later on.  Just turn your mind off for a few hours and enjoy a good popcorn flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is a very different hostage/bank robbery drama.  A group of bad guys led by Clive Owen take over a bank in lower Manhattan.  Instead of taking the money and running, Owen's band take all the people in the bank hostages and make them all wear the same uniform and masks that they are wearing (so the cops can't tell the good guys from the bad guys and neither can the hostages too as a matter of fact).  They then make it clear to the police that arrive on the scene outside that they have a hostage situation in the bank.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is called in to be the hostage negotiator for the police.  Washington was recently involved in a scandal that prevented him from getting a promotion.  In the meantime the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) is meeting with Jodie Foster.  Apparently there is something in one of the bank's safe deposit boxes that Plummer wants protected.  This causes Foster to call in some favors (with the mayor and others) so she can be let into the bank without interference from Washington and talk to the bad guys directly.<br /><br />I keep saying this movie is very different.  Firstly you are never too sure what the bad guys want but you suspect it has to do with what Plummer doesn't want them to have.  Also the movie has some interesting directing and story telling which seems to go back and forth between the hostage standoff and interviews with people that were in the bank after everything was resolved.<br /><br />Washington and Owen both give brilliant performances and Willem DaFoe is excellent in a supporting role.  It is a well conceived and brilliantly executed movie.  The only drawback to me is that it was never quite clear how Owen learned what he did about what was in the bank.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Gifted director Spike Lee did a brilliant job in coordinating his impressive cast of actors with an intriguing and convoluted script written by novice Russell Gewirtz, in the crime thriller "Inside Man".  Lee, the New York city icon, used panoramic camera angles in depicting his adopted home town, particularly the Wall Street area, as a backdrop for this drama.  Lee made effective use of flashforwards in presenting the plot, a cleverly contrived bank robbery that quickly spiraled into a hostage taking standoff.<br /><br />Criminal mastermind Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen led a well trained team into a Manhattan bank where they quickly assumed control.  Forcing the large group of hostages to strip and dress in the same outfits as the robbers, he homogenized the confined group.  Hostage negotiating NYPD detective Keith Frazier played by talented Denzel Washington, a cool cerebral yet compromised investigator owing to a recent bust that went bad, wall called in to deal with Owen.<br /><br />The bank was owned by Jewish chairman of the board Arthur Case played by veteran Christopher Plummer.  Plummer was prepared to go to great lengths to maintain secrecy of his affairs which were documented within a safety deposit box located at the bank.  Plummer had been a Nazi collaborator against his own people harvesting untold riches which he used to start his banking empire.  As a result, Plummer called in smug and refined power broker Madeleine White played by Jodie Foster to help maintain secrecy while she negotiated with Owen.<br /><br />We soon see that there is an ulterior motive to the affair as Owen appears to be stalling for time.  Washington realizes that things are amiss but is shackled from pursuing his investigation by higher ups.<br /><br />The movie concludes with an unexpected interaction between Washington and Owen highlighting the mutual respect each man had for the other.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>`Inside Man' is a good film. It's essentially a standard hostage situation thriller that wasn't over the top. From the moment it begins, there is clearly an urban vibe; the shots of Manhattan, not to mention the movie being billed as "A Spike Lee joint" give it a grittier tone. Do not let these minor touches fool you; as the movie progresses, it helps to not go in with preconceived notions of the typical Spike Lee movie. The camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever.<br /><br />Clive Owen is great as, a "not your everyday bank robber," he's becoming one of my favorite actors. Denzel Washington played the lead role of the perceptive (if slightly jaded) police-detective. He gives us an incredibly performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films. It's an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialogue. Jodie Foster is disappointingly underused as Madeline, so to with Christopher Plummer as Arthur. Willem Dafoe flounders in the background, it looks like he doesn't know why he's there. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers one of the better performances, yet not his best from his other recent film. The dialogue in the movie is good. There's some humorous and great lines that come out of the character's mouths.<br /><br />What I liked about Inside Man was the style it was made. It is choppy, but not so much, you get a sense of tension, and it seems very high paced. The plot is good, and very intriguing. There are some things you have to figure out throughout the film, which makes it more interesting. My only problem was that after the bank robbery was over, the film continued for another half hour, and it started to drag a bit.<br /><br />Aside from minor problems it's a safe bet if you want an enjoyable film and one of Spike Lee's finest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Inside Man is a new film by acclaimed director Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing), and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Clive Owen (Sin City), Christopher Plummer (Syriana), and Jodie Foster (Flightplan). Inside Man would be the latest collaboration between Lee and Washington, after such films as 1992's Malcolm X, and 1998's He Got Game.<br /><br />Spike Lee surprises audiences this time around with a suspenseful heist thriller, a territory that he hadn't experimented with up until Inside Man.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays bank robber Dalton, who leads a gang into a New York City bank one day, forces the hostages to wear the same clothes they are wearing including black hoodies and white masks. Washington plays troubled detective Keith Frazier, who is trying to negotiate with Dalton to let hostages go and find out what he wants. In the meantime, bank owner Arthur Case, played by Plummer, is afraid the robbers might uncover a secret document in one of the safe boxes in the bank, so he assigns a tough-as-nails problem solver named Madeline White, played by Foster, to try to strike a deal with the robbers. What Frazier is about to uncover are deep secrets and a very unexpected surprise as the events unfold.<br /><br />Despite some flaws and a few vague characters, I enjoyed Inside Man. Denzel Washington, as usual, delivers a fine performance, and Spike Lee's direction is right on target.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Dalton Russell tells views in the beginning that he's going to reveal everything once only, and that the viewer had better keep up.  He and his gang of thieves infiltrate a large metropolitan bank and get caught inside.  Detective Frazier, who is struggling with an Internal Affairs problem of his own, as well as a girlfriend who's ready to tie the knot, gets called in to handle the negotiations.  Only the bank robbers aren't in any hurry to negotiate.  As the hours spin out, with SWAT teams ready to invade and a rich man growing more desperate by the minute, the plot twists and twists again as all of the characters play out their own agendas.  Frazier knows early on that this isn't a typical -- and may not be at all -- robbery.<br /><br />Spike Lee directed the movie.  He and Denzel Washington (Detective Frazier) have paired on MALCOLM X.  The director has had a string of movies, choosing material that he wanted to work with.  Denzel has been in MAN ON FIRE, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, OUT OF TIME, RICOCHET, JOHN Q, TRAINING DAY, THE BONE COLLECTOR, THE SIEGE, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, and CRIMSON TIDE, all of which might be of interest to viewers of this film.  Jodie Foster has starred in FLIGHTPLAN, PANIC ROOM, and SHADOWS AND FOG.  Clive Owen has begun a successful American film career after enjoying one in England for several years.  He's starred in DERAILED, SIN CITY, and THE DRIVER.<br /><br />The movie progresses at a relatively slow pace, and doesn't really deepen any of the characters to any degree, but it does offer the viewer plenty of chances to guess what's going on.  The suspense mounts slowly, and the ending comes together in a manner that is almost anti-climatic.  The mood and atmosphere play out nicely, with enough characters introduced to make the situation even more complicated.  It's easy to watch and is entertaining in a what's-going-on way more than a thrill-a-minute way.  The film almost harkens back to the 1950s in its stylistic set-up and gentle, uncompressed storytelling.<br /><br />Once the movie is over, though, a thinking viewer will see a tremendous amount of plotholes as well as scenes that were actually distractions from the plot and red herrings to the mystery solvers.  But it did play fairly so that going back and putting the pieces together makes sense.  The final resolution of the stand-off at the bank was played almost too low-key to satisfy.  If it hadn't been for the question about what was actually going on still in play, viewers might tend to be disappointed.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN is a good movie for an evening home with a buddy who loves movies, or with a spouse.  Fans of Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, and Clive Own can see their stars in some of the best on-screen presence they've had.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is going to be (for me) a brief review for the simple reason that without delving into the content of the film I find it hard to write about except in the most glittering of generalities.  And this really is a film that would be more enjoyable the less one knows about it.  So let me cut to the chase if you haven't seen this but are tempted:  it will be worth your time.<br /><br />This is not at all your typical Spike Lee film.  In almost all of his films, Lee has been concerned to make a social statement of sorts, and while I am completely in sympathy with his social and political beliefs, they have sometimes lessened the films as vehicles for telling stories (though DO THE RIGHT THING was made even better by the message, being one of the best political films ever made in America).  The point here is to tell a great yarn and there is little question the film succeeds wonderfully.<br /><br />All I'll say about the content of the film is that it involves a bank robbery and hostage situation.  Comparisons to DOG DAY AFTERNOON utterly miss the point of the film.  If you are thinking, "DOG DAY AFTERNOON" you are in the wrong frame of mind.  It is a film in which nothing is what it seems.  And even in saying that I've said too much, so let me just usher another encouragement to see the film and hand out some kudos.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is, well, Denzel Washington.  He is one of the finest actors of his generation and while this is not one of his best performances, it is one of his typical ones.  Clive Owen is spectacular as the head of the group taking over the bank.  He is an enormously gifted performer and ever since seeing him in THE CROUPIER I have been waiting to see his career explode.  He has one of the great gazes in the movies, and one of those performers who seems to glide between being congenial to utterly threatening in a matter of seconds.  Jodie Foster is a great actress, but though she is enormously competent in her part, it really isn't one designed to let her shine.  Likewise, Willem Dafoe is a frequently compelling actor, but he is largely on the sidelines in this one.  Ditto the amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor, a handsome and extremely talented English actor of Nigerian parentage who I believe is only a role or two away from stardom.  He is appealing here as Washington's partner, but he isn't given any opportunity to show what he can doe.  For a better sense of his talent, check out his work in DIRTY PRETTY THINGS or his turn as a true believing assassin in the Sci-fi gem SERENITY.<br /><br />The real star of the film, however, is not Spike Lee or any of his actors.  It is writer Russell Gewirtz, who with this script makes his screen debut.  This is a wonderfully constructed, deliciously complex script.  It results in one of those movies you love to pry apart and dissect afterwards, to see if it makes as much sense afterwards as it did when you were watching it.  The rumor is that Ron Howard was going to direct this originally, but pulled out in favor of directing CINDERELLA MAN.  With no disrespect to either Howard or Lee, my guess is that the original script was so good that it would have been difficult to make a bad movie out of it.<br /><br />So far 2006 has looked like another slow movie year, though there is plenty of time for that to turn around.  Although for most of my adult life I have seen roughly 300-450 movies a year (one year I saw 600, with nearly daily double headers on the VCR), in recent years I have shifted my attention more and more towards TV, the best TV shows being better, in my opinion, than the vast majority of films.  This is not a film that will win any awards, but it a thoroughly entertaining film that I hope will be a prelude to better things to come out of Hollywood this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>After the disaster in 2004 that was "She Hate Me", Spike Lee is back in top form here with "Inside Man", a great thriller starring Denzel Washington (Training Day, Fallen) as Detective Keith Frazier who with Detective Bill Mitchell played by the always superb Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity, Four Brothers) go to a bank where Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen (Sin City, Croupier) is talking hostage. Why is he doing it? What does he want? Well, Denzel doesnt think it's a bank robbery. There's someone off about this particular robbery in which the money isnt even taking. During the film we see Denzel and Chiwetel talking to hostages that were in the building because Clivey Boy had every single hostage strip and put on painters suits and masks which the robbers were wearing as well so it would confuse the police. Christopher Plummer (Sound of Music, The New World) plays Arthur Case the bank owner who goes to Madeline White played by Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Flightplan) who still beautiful at her age. There is something within the bank that holds value to Plummer which if it gets out could probably ruin Plummer. Which is basically why Owen is in the bank in the first place. I dont wanna give away any more details just go see this great movie for yourselves. Denzel is back in top form. He hasnt made a movie since The Manchurian Candidate and he gives a blazing performance as usual. Clive Owen! Come on! This guy is the word "awesome". Hes a force to be reckoned here. He's brilliant. What was with the music Spike at the beginning and end? That song was kinda weird. Also starring the fantastic Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the Vampire, Boondock Saints), Kim Director (Blair Witch 2, Summer of Sam), Daryl "Chill" Mitchell (10 Things I Hate About You), Ken Leung (Keeping the Faith, Rush Hour) and Peter Frechette (Profiler, Grease 2). One of the best movies so far to come out this year, well that's what I think</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington is really, really good in this film. It is one of his best performances in a long while. Clive Owen is good as usual and Jodie Foster makes the most out of her small role. Inside Man also boasts a clever story with realistic dialogue (you won't get any Tarantino lines here), some of which had the theater laughing in a good way. The twist was unique, but it wasn't that mind blowing. I don't regret spending $7.00 and two and a half hours of my day on this film.

With that being said there are a couple of directors that I find this to be a particularly hard task to succeed in, Quentin Tarentino is one such director and the other is Spike Lee.  I have to say that whenever either of these two critically acclaimed directors releases a movie (or a `joint' as Spike Lee prefers to label them), I find it difficult to get too excited about seeing them, and sometimes I don't end up seeing the movie at all, though I try to make an effort because you never know when one might hit you just right.  So, when I saw the trailer for the upcoming Spike Lee movie "Inside Man" starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, I was somewhat interested in it simply because I enjoy both actors' work; however, Denzel had done a Spike Lee movie before that I didn't like, so that didn't guarantee that I would enjoy him in this one.  Over time I saw more trailers for the movie and read what the film was to be about and I have to say that for the first time ever, I was actually excited to see a Spike Lee movie, but whether my anticipation was misplaced or completely justified would remain to be seen.<br /><br />"Inside Man" presents us with the story of a brilliant criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who has devised the perfect bank robbery and subsequent escape without being caught by the law.  However, when the plan is hatched events quickly begin to spiral out of control and the police are fast on the scene led by a cunningly smart detective (Denzel Washington) who will not rest until the situation is contained.  Just when negotiations are beginning to take shape between the criminals and the police, a government power broker (Jodie Foster) interferes throwing this delicate matter into a state of uncertainty where one wrong move could spell disaster for all involved.<br /><br />After watching this movie I quickly came to the conclusion that even though I generally dislike most Spike Lee movies, even he can surprise me sometimes.  "Inside Man" was a wonderfully constructed cat-and-mouse thriller that was completely engrossing and a genuine surprise to me, and was by far the most mainstream Spike Lee movie to date.  The story was well paced, full of twists-and-turns that you don't see coming, and the dialogue was so well-written and at times an absolute joy to listen to, especially the many exchanges between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's characters.  The acting was terrific from all actors involved, each actor was given so much to work with, which is often a rarity in an ensemble piece like this one, where there are so many A-list actors gathered in one film, generally one or two of them get shorted on development.  A lot of the fun I had in watching this movie was trying to figure out the various motives every character had or which side they were truly on, so many of the characters had hidden agendas you really didn't know what to expect from any of them, which made the experience all the more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />As I said earlier I'm not by any means a Spike Lee fan and enjoying this movie doesn't change that fact, but for me to have been even remotely entertained by this film is a feat in and of itself.  With all that being said, I think it would be nice to see more independent-type directors, such as Spike Lee or Quentin Tarentino, make more mainstream films and maybe, just maybe, I would like their work a whole lot more than simply one movie here and there.<br /><br />"Inside Man" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>After watching "Inside Man", starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster, I tried to think of something, anything that didn't work. Honestly, I couldn't. "Inside Man" is an excellent, enjoyable film.<br /><br />Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and his crew walk into a large bank in the middle of the Manhattan financial district, dressed as painters, and begin to rob the facility. This crew is professional; Russell seems to have thought of everything, down to the infrared lamps to knock out the security cameras. Detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Dirty Pretty Things", "Four Brothers") are the assigned hostage negotiating team. Frazier has a dark spot on his record, so he is anxious for the opportunity to prove himself. As soon as Mr. Case (Christopher Plummer) hears the news of the hold-up at his bank, he enlists the help of power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster); he needs her help to ensure that something in his bank remains in his bank.<br /><br />"Inside Man" is a heist film. As soon as you realize that, you know a good example of the genre will be fun, light and breezy, keep you guessing and take you on a bit of a roller coaster ride. Check on all points. "Inside Man" is a great example of the genre.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of Spike Lee's films. Film is an art form and the best films engage your imagination, feelings and emotion. Too many of Lee's films (and Oliver Stone's for that matter) bludgeon the viewer over the head with their message. Great films also have a point of view, but Lee's films always seem to portray the ONLY message, according to the filmmaker. If you disagree, screw you.<br /><br />If "Inside Man" did not have Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster in it, I probably would not have seen it, because of director Spike Lee. I am glad I did see it because it is an excellent film. All four people are integral to the film's success, but the biggest surprise for me is Spike Lee.<br /><br />Any successful heist film is going to have to move, keep the viewer engaged and provide a form of suspense. Lee clearly recognizes the rules of this type of film and runs with them, playing with them a bit, but keeping them intact. Addressing each of the conventions of this genre, he makes them his own. All of the key points are depicted, and depicted well, leaving no stone unturned. Of course, in a heist film, the stones are unturned when and if the writer and director feel like it. I think he realized he wasn't going to be able to solve the race problems in our society, with this film, and decided to have fun. This is his most mainstream, most commercial film.<br /><br />This is not to say that Lee has gone soft. He incorporates messages and ideas into the framework of this convention. For instance, when a bank employee is released by Dalton, in disguise, the cops approach with caution. When they remove the mask, they reveal he is wearing a turban. One of the cops shouts "He's an Arab" and they tackle him to the ground. Later, an exchange between this man and Frazier leads to some telling comments about our country's current paranoia against anyone who appears different and also one of the funniest lines of dialogue I have heard in some time. Another memorable exchange concerns a video game and there are many more instances like this throughout. As the machinations of the heist are in progress, these moments help make the characters more real and the film even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Like the best Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorcese and Woody Allen films, Lee uses New York City as a character. A lot of the crew's plan depends on certain aspects of life in the large metropolis. At one point, Dalton walks right by a bank employee and they only give him a cursory glance. The city's melting pot of personalities and cultures also provides a rich backdrop for the film. Every character has been changed by life in New York and they change the story for good and bad. From cops who immediately set-up crowd barriers to keep the onlookers back, to a cop who is dedicated to his job, but racist due to his interaction with the public, to citizens who expect a little quid pro quo for helping the cops, everyone gives the film a richness sorely lacking from most multiplexes.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's Detective Frazier is one of the actor's most memorable characters. Even with the blight on his record, he is confident, gung ho and ready for the challenge. Arriving at the bank, he meets with Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), the police officer in charge of tactical operations. Darius is used to working with someone else and immediately discounts Frazier's presence. But the Detective realizes this will not help the situation and quickly establishes his authority. Throughout, he is always thinking, trying to guess Dalton's next move before it happens. He proves very adept at this and equally good dealing with New York.<br /><br />His character has good dialogue throughout, adding an air of levity. When we first meet Frazier, he is discussing his relationship with his girlfriend, in frank and suggestive terms, establishing his character very quickly. Frazier jokes with people throughout, while at the same time is ready to instantly become serious should the need arise, adapting to the changes. When he is interrogating people, this same tactic proves disarming, disorienting people, perhaps allowing some truth to get through.<br /><br />Clive Owen ("Gosford Park", the unfortunate "Derailed") is very good as Dalton Russell, the mastermind behind the robbery. Clearly, Russell has thought through the entire plan, many times, in an attempt to ensure everything goes flawlessly. Dalton frequently seems tired of, or perhaps resigned to, dealing with less, intelligent people. He seems to treat people with slight scorn, deriding them because they are less intelligent.<br /><br />Dalton is always clear and calculating. Through most of the film, he even appears to be more ruthless than you might think, adding an unexpected element to the heist. The film is also good about casting doubts on his character a few times; we begin to wonder if he has, in fact, thought of everything.<br /><br />Jodie Foster's Madeline White is, essentially, a supporting character, but no less memorable. As a high powered power broker, Madeline thinks everyone is beneath her, including her clients for needing her in the first place. But that doesn't stop her from working for them, and extracting huge fees. The great thing about Madeline is that even though she is a powerful woman and disliked by everyone she meets, she recognizes this and doesn't care. She knows that everyone she meets; from the Detective, to the Mayor, to Mr. Case, to Dalton Russell, everyone no matter how small, will one day be a person who can help her make new clients, settle new business, and create new favors.<br /><br />"Inside Man" is the best film I have seen so far this year. If Spike Lee continues to direct films like this, I might even become a fan and eagerly anticipate his new films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>This fourth Spike Lee/Denzel Washington collaboration in many ways is the most conventional and the one that has the least to do with Spike's own voice -- he's operating off a thriller script he did not create -- but there are still signs that "Inside Man" is still a Spike Lee Joint.<br /><br />There's the signature shot of a protagonist moving down the street on a rolling cart instead of walking, an off-hand discussion of the damage done by videogames that glamorize the gangsta lifestyle and, as always, a lot of Spike's signature camera work and camera shots. For big Spike Lee fans, this might not be as much Spike as they want, but the film is still definitely worth watching.<br /><br />It's a smart thriller, not so much a "whodunnit" as a "what, exactly, did they do?" Clive Owen appears at the very beginning of the film, laying out what's happened in the film, with an implicit challenge to the viewers to figure out exactly what they're about to see. The bank robbery that follows is mysterious and more clever than it at first appears to be and the entire affair takes on extra realism thanks to an extremely good cast, including a number of lower-tier character actors putting in solid work, and especially Christopher Plummer and a surprisingly disquieting Jodie Foster, playing against type.<br /><br />The final resolution doesn't have quite the emotional pop that may have been intended, but it's an intellectually satisfying one.<br /><br />"Inside Man" could have used more of Spike Lee's signature style to spice things up, but it's still a very solid little caper movie and well worth seeing for fans of such films or Spike Lee Joints.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>It is a long standing Hollywood tradition that inspired, quality directors take on "for hire" projects in order to be able to make films that are closer to their hearts. Recent examples include Steven Soderbergh and the "Oceans 11-12" films, F.F. Coppola and "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and the "Rainmaker" as well as Spike Lee  and "25 Hours."<br /><br />Results have been mostly good ("BS Dracula) and not so good ("25 Hours"). But nonetheless, quality directors, despite the material, always elevate it by way of their personal point of view and sterling story-telling techniques.<br /><br />Spike Lee, director of the sublime "Malcolm X" directs this film, "Inside Man," basically a bank heist film, and elevates it to, if not Art, then to a mostly exciting, well crafted thriller with terrific performances by the always reliable Denzel as NYC Hostage Negotiator, Keith Frazier and Clive Owen as Bank Robber, Dalton Russell. The only problematic performance comes from the luminous Jodie Foster as a kind of go to woman who has friends in high places, whose actual profession is murky but who is very well paid for her service. The problem is her role is not well thought out and written and though Foster cannot help but have her special moments, she cannot get her arms and remarkable talent around this role.<br /><br />Directing from a good script by Russell Gewirtz, "Inside Man" is a fun, interesting, well-made popular entertainment that almost always keeps your mind and eyes interested.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>OK, forgive me here while I stretch my female sense of incredulity. Denzel Washington. And. Clive Owen. In one movie. Give me a portable fan and some smelling salts and let me revel in two of my favorite "guys" on the big screen. ..... All right, I'm calm now. Time to review.<br /><br />Denzel Washington has made all too many movies that start out the same....just another tale, with Denzel being competent and cool, and the film being somewhat provocative, but somewhat forgettable. "Inside Man" starts out like that. It seems predictable, but it rapidly becomes something else.<br /><br />The big attraction here is Spike Lee who has been better lately, as an actor (in the documentary...."Through the Fire"), than as a director in recent years ("She Hate Me" (?) "Sucker Free City" (?); give me strength!). His "25th Hour" was passable; self-indulgent, slow, poorly edited -- and with a cast to die for (Ed Norton, P.Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Anna Pacquin, Rosario Dawson, New York City!), Lee shoulda done better. Shoulda, coulda, did, finally with this film. Lee found his screenwriter (a rookie) and his editor for "Inside Man", and they are both forces to be reckoned with. And what a cast he rounded up!<br /><br />The movie's complex, it flashes, moves, unnerves you with the fact that you can't figure it out. Clive Owen is holding up a bank and seems forced to take hostages. The hostages are clothed the same as Clive's gang. Now, who is hostage and who is robber? Is he really there to rob the bank, or did he have another agenda? Owen is Dalton Russell and he's about to pull a bait and switch on everyone else.<br /><br />Dalton's foil is the hostage negotiator, you guessed it, Washington, as a man with other places he'd rather be. Washington washes with the flow of the film, does a smooth job, works off partner Bill Mitchell (the solid actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, from "Dirty, Pretty Things"). He's daunted by Dalton, but who is the cat, and who is the mouse?<br /><br />Once you add the smarmy Christopher Plummer (just as good as he was in Syriana) who owns the bank and is clearly more worried about some secret that is in danger, and his agent provacateur, Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to the mix, you're swimming in talent, plot and cattiness. Foster provides a lot of barbs, a quick, cutting wit, and the ice that a certain former First Lady is famous for.<br /><br />And, if you're like me, the truth about the robbery will begin to dawn on you just as the film begins to close, and you'll be glad you plunked down your $8 to see a fine, really fine Spike-Denzel-Clive and the gang film. A film that involves you; a film that makes you sit up and take notice. A film that puts Spike Lee back on the map.<br /><br />It's not award-winning, but I've got to give "Inside Man" a 4 star rating, for the sheer enjoyment of it all!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Inside Man" appears to be about a robbery at a large Manhattan bank, but there's much more to it than what meets the eye. Denzel Washington plays NYPD Detective Keith Frazier, who attempts to outsmart the mastermind of the bank robbery (Clive Owen). However, what appears to be an "ordinary" robbery/hostage situation turns out to be a personal vendetta to expose evil secrets from long ago. Throw Jodie Foster into the mix as a mysterious problem solver of sorts, and you end up with a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />There are quite a few holes in the plot, but "Inside Man" is definitely a lot of fun to watch, although I doubt I'll ever sit down and watch it again. It's much more refreshing than the so-called "thrillers" Hollywood has been cranking out recently, so that in itself is a relief. This is an entertaining film with a lot of great one-liners and an excellent cast.

I usually avoid his films like the plague since I've grown tired of his preaching on race and the ills of this country but for once, he has delivered a solid, entertaining movie.  The cast, for starters, is excellent. Denzil Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer & Chiwetel Ejiotor really deliver the goods in this slick heist movie.  Seemingly a heist film, this film is more than that and thank god, Lee steers away from his political preaching.  If you've avoided his films in the past, do check this one out--you'll probably like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Here's a heist-negotiator story done with a few different angles.  Among the "twists" are (1) a bank president who hires someone to try to get something NOT robbed out of his band during the heist, evidence that could destroy his status and career, and (2) the crooks all get away with the mastermind of group hiding in the bank for a week before slipping away in broad daylight. That last part leads me to ask a few questions about that could possibly happen, specifically how get could get out of the vault where he was hidden without all kinds of alarms going off, etc.<br /><br />Nevertheless, credibility-aside, its an interesting two hours of entertainment, sort of a modern-day Dog Day Afternoon film. (In fact, DDA is mentioned in the movie.)<br /><br />The four lead actors in this film are all quite diverse: a veteran cop (Denzel Washington), the main crook (Clive Owen), the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and the professional business woman he hires (Jodie Foster.) All of them are fascinating, thanks in large part to the fact they are all outstanding actors to begin with. Unlike most people, I particularly enjoyed Foster playing such a controlled, low-key character and the same could be said about another top actor in here: Willem DaFoe.<br /><br />The more I think about it, the actors here are just as fascinating as the story, if not more so. I am sure it will be them, not the story, that drives me back for more viewings.  One warning for families: there are lots of f-words in here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>The cast including Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer is outstanding. Spike Lee directing has always impressed me but his movies are not usually for the whole family. In fact it is rare that the whole family can sit down and watch an adult movie these days that will be only slightly offensive to some. Here is such a movie. At first you will think you know what is happening, then you will figure it out. That is until the next scene. This is one of those, so you think you know what is going to happen next movies. The ending will make you satisified and on many levels, including lack of real violence. After all it is the perfect bank robbery.<br /><br />We are led to believe this movie is about bank robbers and hostages with a tense stand off with police. Okay there is some of that, but it goes much further. Do the robbers intend to take the money? No, but perhaps not what you think to substitute for it. The story unfolds so that we now think an outside negotiator will settle the deal and that's the end of it. But no we have an honest detective that wants the whole story and that is where it will all end when he lays all the cards on the table. I recommend this to the whole family. It is slick enough that it has replayability and I suggest those that like movies like "The Italian Job" buy it since it has the suspense and con stuff less the violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>After "Clockers" I gave up on Spike Lee.  Even though he is a talented moralist, boring and rote is still boring and rote.  So it was with some trepidation that I picked up "Inside Man."  Could he keep his predilections under wraps for once, the way Lynch did with "Straight Story"?  The answer is mostly yes.*  It's a great detective-drama-action movie, a whodunit with good characters and articulate plot twists.  Even people like me who have grown skeptical of Spike Lee's abilities would be pleased with the movie.<br /><br />*  He still couldn't resist totally gratuitous references to violent video games, white cop bigotry and proper gun safety.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This is one of the most successful boxoffice films for the formidable director Spike Lee.  Fortunately, he is blessed with performers like Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe.  They are excellent in their roles in this unusual heist film which ultimately turns into a hostage situation for something more than money.<br /><br />Washington brings his cool reserve and winning sense of humor to his role as the hostage negotiator who has his own internal problems as well; Owen is quietly sinister in his role as the henchman of the robbery; Foster is superb in a strange role as a different kind of negotiator; Plummer is effective as the bank owner with his own dark secrets; and an unusually subdued Dafoe is stoic as a policeman working with Washington.<br /><br />Lee's direction is crisp and on target.  My main problem with the movie is the lack of giving Owen any history that explains how he knows Plummer's secret and just what he hopes to accomplish.  If that had been a little more clearer, this movie could have become a much better film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Inside Man is not your average bank robbery action film. It's a thought provoking thriller that will have you guessing until the last scene. Denzel Washington stars in the film as a detective thrust into the middle of a huge bank robbery. Dozens of people-including women and children are being held hostage by seemingly ruthless bank robbers. After talking with the bank robber in charge, Denzel's character feels that there is more to this robbery than appears. Something just doesn't ring right with the robber's demands. Jodie Foster has a small role in the film as a broker who works closely with the bank. Clive Owen stars as the mastermind of the complex robbery.<br /><br />Inside Man was directed by critically acclaimed director Spike Lee. The DVD includes bonus features which include deleted scenes, a documentary about the working history of Spike Lee and Denzel Washington, feature commentary and the making of Inside Man.<br /><br />My husband really enjoyed this film but I personally felt let down. There is so much action around the climax of the film and as the film comes down there is no big bang or big action scene it kind of came in like a lion and ended like a lamb.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Is INSIDE MAN supposed to be a mindlessly stimulating bank heist film? Or a thought-provoking take on urbanism, race, money, power, and history? Blending the two would've been a spectacular feat, but INSIDE MAN too often misses the mark or simply stretches credibility to the breaking point.<br /><br />The story starts like a basic heist flick but with a few subtle quirks. Clive Owen stars as bank robber genius Dalton Russell who takes over a bank in Manhattan, hostages and all. But why he's there is the big running question. He makes no move to dash in and out with the money, and seems content to sit and wait out the police.<br /><br />Enter Denzel Washington as Junior Detective Keith Frazer. Being a hostage negotiator, the detective decides to play by the book, waiting out Dalton's gang and making false promises of arriving buses and planes. But Detective Frazer soon realizes that something is amiss. Dalton is delaying everything, too. And none of the hostages have been killed, even when deadline demands come and go.<br /><br />Into the fray comes Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the banks founder. He has secrets in a safety deposit box that he'll do anything to keep secret. In rapid (and confusing) fashion, he contacts Madeline White (Jodi Foster, FLIGHTPLAN ), a woman who has contacts in high places and can usually get whatever a client wants. Bending the ear of the mayor, Ms. White gets on the inside with the police and secures a private meeting with Dalton, who quickly advises her that he's already opened Mr. Case's safety deposit box and retrieved ....<br /><br />Okay, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.<br /><br />Suffice to say there are good qualities about the film (thus my positive rating). The acting is spot-on perfect (from Willem Dafoe's grumpy street cop persona to Clive Owen's questionable bank robber status). Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage-takers/robbers (White masks? Hmm. Think he's trying to tell us something?) The movie's pace was satisfactory, too. It perhaps got bogged down in some of the overly-developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen -- Foster -- into the bank with armed suspects regardless of her contacts).<br /><br />There are also a lot of irritatingly undeveloped items. Most notably were Jodi Foster's character and the basis for Clive Owen's gang. There is no history surrounding Foster's character so we don't know how she got started in this business (whatever her "business" was) nor how Christopher Plummer's character knows how to get ahold of her. Clive Owen's gang must've been some sort of modern day Nurembergers, still tracking down Nazi and Nazi sympathizers, but why and where they came from remains a mystery throughout.<br /><br />In recent typical Hollywood fashion, the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys are better than all. Christopher Plummer plays the dark figure we so love to see him play that it is, unfortunately, almost a clich&eacute;. Denzel is the black detective trying to advance his career while at the same time battling prejudice within his own department (another clich&eacute;?).<br /><br />Still, it was fun to watch. The fact that there's really no bloodshed makes this bank heist film unique by current day standards. Most have explosions with bodies flying through the air and clip after clip after clip of ammo being loosed. Not here.<br /><br />If you've got a few hours to kill at home, you might consider plopping this into your DVD player and checking it out. Just don't think too hard about the INSIDE MAN after it's over.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>nicely done! very intereting thriller. of course, the scenario and the plot are still with lot of holes if you want to be picky. but as long as you could watch it and don't have the urge to stand up and leave, it means that this is a very good movie, so good that could hold you tight on your seat. i enjoy it very much. i don't want to write a spoiler review.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Inside Man" is brilliant!

Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself."<br /><br />It is so great to go to a movie and have it fulfill high expectations for one.  The trailer and the television commercials for "Inside Man" piqued my curiosity, and since Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster signed on, and Spike Lee ended up directing the movie, I decided I had to go see the first showing the first day do that I could find out what exactly is the game going on with this bank robbery that is not a bank robbery.  I figured that armed with the idea that the perfect crime is the one that you do not know has been committed,<br /><br />Dalton Russell (Owen), the man who came up with this perfect crime, might not repeat himself, but the words he speaks into the camera at the beginning of the film are repeated when the revelation comes and you see the total audacity of his plan.  This is one of those movies where somebody tells you what they are doing and it does not matter because you are probably not going to figure it out (okay, some people will, but they are either smarter than me or we are talking the old saying about blind hogs).  Detective Keith Frazier (Washington), is in the hostage negotiator in charge, with fellow Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), at his side.  The bank in question belongs to Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) and clearly the last thing he is worried about is the money that is there.  So he contacts Madeliene White (Foster), who has always been the sort of woman who arranges thing for a nice but not necessarily small fee.<br /><br />It takes Frazier a while to catch on that the guy in charge inside the bank is the smartest one in the game (or, at the very least, he has all of the angles figured out).  Certainly when White comes away from her face-to-face with the masked man in the bank she knows that this guy is so far ahead of her she is never going to catch up.  But a key thing here is that these are smart people, capable of making mistakes but also able to make the necessary connections that lead to explaining what the hell is going on here.  Also, it was nice to see that the cops in this film were pretty competent for the most part, from the first cop on the scene to Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), who is in charge of the tactical part of the operation.  I was wondering if this might be post-9/11 good will, but actually it is necessary for the film to work: the cops have to be competent.  The whole point is to beat them at their best.<br /><br />The screenplay is written by Russell Gewirtz, and since this is his first filmed script he is either going to be one of the hottest scribes in Hollywood or he is going to spend the rest of his life trying to prove this one is no fluke.  I think Spike Lee had a hand in some of the bits, simply because there are so few moments where "Inside Man" seems like a Spike Lee Joint and you remember who is directing this one (admit it: you were surprised this was a 40 Acres and Mule film).  Things really move in this one and you never get the sense of it being a drawn out hostage crisis.  Besides, it is also a way of not giving you time to figure out what is going on.  Even when we get flashforwards to Frazier and Mitchell interviewing the hostages (or are they the criminals?), the film is not doing us any real favors.<br /><br />Of course you want to try and figure out what is going on, because that is part of the fun.  As soon as "Chaiyya Chaiyya" starts playing I am trying to figure out what sort of clue this song from the "Bombay Dreams" cast album has to do with the story.  But Gewirtz is to us as Dalton is to the police; there is a point early one when you turn to each other and think you have spotted a key clue (off of the "Ten Little Indians" rule that if you do not see something, then it did not happen).  But this is just one of several insidious red herrings, some of which are brilliantly put in the commercials.  Afterwards if you stop and think about it you can find minor flaws in the story, but that is true of any such story.  When the last act begins I leapt to a correct conclusion, which got me thinking that when Frazier completed his interviews he would come to the same conclusion, albeit by a different method.  Even so, I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed by the way this one plays out.<br /><br />There are a few moments when Lee gets a bit cute with what he is doing (e.g., Denzel on a moving platform), but he is allowed to indulge.  Washington makes wearing a hat look good again and while the character Owen plays requires him to do the same sort of barely modulated monotone he always seems to be doing it is Foster who has the most fun playing a role without a scintilla of the vulnerability that are her trademark and reminding us there is a level beyond the b-word.  She has the cold smile of a snake down pretty good.  Final Note: As usual I was the only one who stuck around for all of the credits, but the totally addictive opening song comes back at the end, this time as a "Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint" variation.  Since I still had ice left in my drink, I was able to shake it as an impromptu percussion instrument, but I still have no clue as to what it signifies for the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was the "Inside Man" DVD starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster and directed by Spike Lee. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was billed on the DVD cover as "A heist thriller like you've never seen." Well, there's a certain truth in that statement. The movie depicted a small, but very well-equipped group of men who invaded a bank and quickly took over and locked everybody in. There might nave been 40 or 50 employees and customers in the bank and they became instant hostages. Of course, the NYC police, with Denzel Washington in the lead role, responded quickly and moved a small army around the bank. Of course, there were  thousands of spectators and the area was crawling with news media people. Then the negotiations began. Of course, the gang wanted a whole list of things including an airplane to carry them away. Nothing seemed to work out and there was a threat to get this thing going or two dead hostages would be thrown out every hour. At this point the movie seemed like a somewhat more serious replay of "Dog Day Afternoon."<br /><br />But wait! A secondary plot was slowly developing in negotiations between the bank president, the Mayor of NYC and Jody Foster. It seemed that the whole bank robbery thing wasn't a robbery at all. No money was taken. No one was killed. A few people were roughed up. That was it. It was the bank president's way of retrieving an incriminating document from his own safe deposit box, the only one that was touched. It seemed that the document indicated that the bank president had dealt with the defeated German government during the ending days of WWII in order to get the money to establish the bank in the first place.<br /><br />Well, the whole movie just seemed to fitter away into nothingness. It had a real promising beginning, tapered off in the middle and then just went into this surrealistic Hollywood plot in the end and turned into a real flop, in my opinion. It became very disappointing as the movie progressed and the movie itself seemed to become longer and longer. I guess you might say that it was a high action movie in which the brakes had been applied and it ground to a boring ending. Too bad. The acting was good. The cinema and production values were excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>I would rate the plot five stars: it is clever, it is logical, and it has its twists and turns. The script is also excellent, with sharp dialogue and some wit.<br /><br />On the negative side: First there is the terrible camera work, with the camera unsteady most of the time, and violently shaking during the scene when the police enter the bank.<br /><br />Secondly, there is the hamming of the actress representing Ms White. Her gratuitous cockiness and nastiness and threats make me sick whenever she appears.<br />The same is true, though to a lessor extent, of the gloating of Detective Frazier. (Incidentally, what did he do with the diamond? Did he pocket it?)</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Inside Man is a Spike Lee directed "Joint" starring academy award winners Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster as well as academy award nominee Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />This is a story of a successful bankrobbery by a wiley criminal (Clive Owen) and a New York Police negotiator, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). The robbers are always one move ahead of the Police Department and keep control of the situation. Not only have they taken over the entire bank, they have about 30 hostages to bargain with. It is a tense situation, and the robbers have the power. During the negotiations the bank chair (Christopher Plummer) brings in Madeline White (Jodie Foster), a tough, cold, yet pleasant power broker.  He needs her discretion to get something out of his safety deposit box to save his reputation. She has connections with the Mayor and asks him for access.  He owes her a favor so she is allowed to meet with the robbers in person to present a "deal".  After she leaves, Detective Frazier also talks to the head of the heist and threatens him.  Before Frazier leaves the robber says "I will walk out of here".<br /><br />As Detective Frazier continues negotiations there are flashbacks of hostage interviews  (so we know they are saved at the end) and witty scenes where the robbers are ordering pizza for hungry hostages.<br /><br />Overall the movie is an energetic, witty, enjoyable thriller that weaves throughout Spike Lee's familiar touching on race, power and class issues.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It's intense fun that never slows down or takes the easy way out, making it one of the coolest movies. A most purely enjoyable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The really good thing about Spike Lee's "Inside Man" is the ensemble of brilliant actors. Denzel Washington is a detective who has an odd choice of fashion and an issue with marriage. Clive Owen is the head of a team of robbers who has something else in mind other than money. Jodie Foster is an antagonistic broker who can easily talk down her victims. Christopher Plummer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors who is willing to keep a secret that's hidden in his own bank. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Denzel's partner in crime who is always willing to be a part of the action. These and many other actors give spectacular performances.<br /><br />But as the film features a great ensemble of actors, the film itself fails to impress. Aside from the shockingly powerful conflicts involving racism and corruption, the plot involving the heist and the overthrow of a government official is something that's already been seen before. If you've seen "Dog Day Afternoon" or have read Nelson DeMille's "Cathedral," then you'll notice that the story in "Inside Man" is nothing really special. Another problem with this film is the uneven third act. With all the hell that's been going on in the last two acts, this final segment contains a much slower pace, which really becomes very tiresome when the last few minutes of the film finally approaches. And speaking of the ending, the last fifteen minutes features two twist endings. But somehow they weren't very shocking. I said to myself, "that was unexpected," but at the same time I said, "but why don't I feel as shocked as I'm supposed to be?" I guess I've seen too many twist endings in recent movies that are kind of like these two, and maybe that's why I'm not surprised at all. But I do believe that the biggest problem with this film is that the jumpy timeline. Once we're in the middle of the bank heist, we start to see some brief scenes that are set in an interrogation room (I won't spoil it for you by telling you exactly which people are inside it). This really spoils the tension and the atmosphere as we already seem to know how this will all end.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Spike Lee is an intelligent director, and all of the actors give great performances that no doubt stick out in this movie. However, the script and the overall climax and resolution don't really work. I still prefer the film "Dog Day Afternoon" (bank heist) and the novel "Cathedral" (political corruption and hostage situation).</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>A gang robs a New York city bank but are trapped inside. They have hostages and want two buses to transport everyone to an airplane at the airport. The police have plans to prevent this. But what if the gang knows what the police are planning and have a trick? [Believable?] Can they use the hostages to divert attention while they escape? [Only in a film.] Was anything stolen from the bank vault? Is one of the safety deposit boxes missing? Did it have any valuables or just documents?<br /><br />The conversations bring out the backgrounds of the characters. The film shows the trick used. [Is it possible to hide in a building for a week?] "No robbers, no loot missing, what happened?" Who would know what happened to that safety deposit box? Does it involve an event from the 1940s? Will Detective Frazier find a clue in his jacket? Will this crime be solved by the end of this film? If not, is this an inherent flaw in this story? [Yes.]<br /><br />The film has some good action scenes in the beginning but loses its way at the end because it lacks a better ending.</p></br></body></html>
