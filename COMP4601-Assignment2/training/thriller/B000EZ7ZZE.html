But to make a feature length film based on source material taken from a video game?  Seems poor prospect (who remembers 1993's Super Mario Bros?  Or how about 1994's Street Fighter?  Man, those were some awful times), but then again I come from a time when video games were pretty simplistic, and had little or no story.  Nowadays, the technology has allowed for extremely well developed storylines within games, and the likelihood of seeing the transition from game consoles to the big screen becoming more and more common.  I mean, look at it like this, if a game sold how many million copies, you pretty much already have a large fan base more than eager to watch a film based on said game.  A built in audience...how can you go wrong?  Well, if you deviate from the storyline, or screw up various elements or characters, you may end up with a fairly rabid pack of angry fans looking for blood...Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), sequel to 2002's Resident Evil film, was written by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, AVP: Alien Vs. Predator), and directed by Alexander Witt, a man who has a ton of 2nd director (this is the guy responsible for filming shots of less importance, such as inserts, crowds, scenery, etc.) credits to his name, but makes his directing debut here.  Returning in her role as Alice from the first film is Milla Jovovich (as far as I can tell, she was the only one who made it into the sequel).  Also appearing is Sienna Guillory (Love Actually), Oded Fehr (Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, The Mummy), Mike Epps (Friday After Next, The Fighting Temptations), and Matthew G. Taylor (Gothika, Detroit Rock City) as Nemesis.<br /><br />The film begins with Umbrella agents in full biohazard gear opening up The Hive, with predictable results (The Hive was a ginormaous, underground research facility that was sealed due to contamination in the first film).  This leads to the T-virus (the contaminate that has the ability to re-animate the dead) to spread into Raccoon City, forcing the Umbrella Corporation, owner of not only The Hive but the city as well, to quarantine the city, sealing many uninfected residents with all kinds of walking dead, many vicious mutations seen in the first film, along with a few new ones.  Alice, joined by a small band of survivors, now trapped inside the city, makes a deal to retrieve the young daughter of a scientist in return for safe passage out of the quarantined area.  Only problem is, besides the legion of hungry undead roaming the streets and hideous, nasty, bitey creatures on the prowl, the Umbrella Corporation has ideas of their own, seeing the situation as a perfect opportunity to test out their latest bio-weapon, Nemesis.  Oh yeah, there's also plans to nuke the city...time is running out (along with their ammunition), for the small group, but they do have an edge, namely, in Alice, as she is more than she appears...<br /><br />Now you don't have to see the original to enjoy this sequel, as the makers of the film provide a certain amount of back-story at the beginning, but you probably should to get the full flavor.  I really wasn't expecting a lot seeing as how this was a sequel and we all know sequels rarely meet the level of the original that spawned said sequel, so I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be pretty good, well, good in the sense that it's a movie based off of a video game.  And that's what I think people should keep in mind, especially those disappointed at the lack of substance within the plot.  A majority of the plot actually extends from the first, setting things up for this picture, which is heavy on action, light on nearly everything else.  I thought the actors did a pretty good job (that Sienna Guillory is one fine, hotsy totsy momma, playing the role of Jill Valentine).  I especially enjoyed Mike Epps as the urban civilian caught up in forces way beyond his control, relating some truly funny lines in a completely realistic manner.  I normally despise comic relief characters, as they're often played so ridiculously over the top that they distract more than anything else, but that wasn't the case here.  The one aspect I disliked the most about the film was the excessive, epileptic, herky jerky camera work and quick cutting, meant to heighten the tension during the more action filled scenes, but it just served to annoy the heck out of me.  This type of direction can be effective in smaller doses, but it's used too often here, and may cause some viewers to reach for the Dramamine.  Also, I thought it odd that every time the undead were shown, their shots were often marred by jittery cutting, as if to highlight something (I don't know what), but it made me wonder if it was done to draw away from the detail, or lack of, concerning the make up of the characters.  There were quite a few characters in this film, each seeming to have their own, little storyline going, but then they're unified nicely once their goals become shared.  The special effects are very slick, and the action rarely slows down, and there's lots of guns, gunfire, explosions, things getting blown up (blown up real good).  I thought the film a little short (it does list a 94 minute running time), but the ending sets up for a possible sequel.<br /><br />I won't bother listing all the special features as Amazon details them nicely, but I will say the picture and audio were excellent.  This is a two disc set, the first DVD containing the film (both widescreen and full screen format), along with some special features, with the 2nd containing the bulk of the extras. 3 ? stars<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>I could not believe how bad this movie was!  Paul Anderson made AvP a bad movie, but I didn't know he could possibly write something this bad.  He even goes as far as stealing the "We are assets, expendable assets" line from Predator and "Newt, I like that" line from Aliens (although it's "Angie, I like that").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said "Fight him" and she said "no".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.  No wonder Paul Anderson didn't direct this, he must have known that it was one of the worst films of 2004 before it was even made.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points.  The only redeeming qualities "Resident Evil-Apocalypse" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of "Dawn of the Dead".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.<br /><br />Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>Coming off the turkey that was "Alien Vs. Predator", Paul W.S. Anderson swings and misses again with another script full of awful dialouge and cardboard characters. Anderson hands over the directing honors to Alexander Witt on this one but it doesn't make too much of a difference. Witt soaks the film in stylized violence and over-produced CGI but unfortunately, such items as "substance" and "content" were thrown on the back-burner, this time around.<br /><br />Starting where the original "Resident" left off, "Apocalypse" has Milla Jovovich's Alice trapped in a zombie plague that has engulfed the fictional Racoon City. Along the way she meets up with female rogue cop Jill Valentine, her partner, and a news reporter. Of course, a representitive of the evil Umbrella Corp. is behind it all. To make matters worse, he throws a genetically-enchanced creature called "Nemesis" into the mix. If the cartoonish super-villian subplot about a corporate honcho who fiendishly sacrifices innocent people for the sake of a major advancement in weaponry has ever see more played out and cheesy than it is here, I have yet to see it.<br /><br />While "Apocalypse" plays out like a mix of "Charlie's Angels" and the "Dawn Of The Dead" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well.While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that "Apocalypse" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel. For all of its faults, if you're looking for a big mindless celebration of action and violence with cheesy dialouge and little of anything else, this could be your cup of tea.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>One word, NEMESIS! "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" takes the viewer straight to the world of the "Resident Evil" video games... and it's a TON of fun. Picking up exactly where the first film left off, "Apocalypse" once again puts the viewer in to the extremely competent shoes of our protagonist/heroine: Alice. This time, Alice is a genetically engineered killing machine who makes it her lot in life to kill as many zombies as possible using motorcycles, automatic weapons and even her own fists. From the start, the film takes off at a break-neck pace and simply doesn't let up through it's concise 94 minutes. Many character are added throughout the film (some great, some... not) but if there's one thing this film IS, it's vintage "Resident Evil."</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>For those who haven't seen probably the most successful adaptation of a video game to live-action film franchise, you might get a kick out of Resident Evil. Starring Milla Jovovich as Alice, a chief security officer for Raccoon City's Umbrella Corporation. Within Umbrella's secret lab called The Hive, a deadly T-Virus accidently gets released, turning most living things into blood-thirsty zombies. Alice, with strange implanted memories haunting her as well, must find a way to stop the virus with a group of various similarly heroic characters, ending up with one last battle with a very large super mutant in end's way.<br /><br />Sound like a video game? Well both the first and second chapter here at times plays out like one, even though minus a few established characters, the storyline here veers off the original plot laid out by Capcom's original playable ones. But to the moderate, and even the more dedicated ones like myself, Resident Evil is a decent addition into Zombiedom. Of course it's not going to surpass original works like 80's Italian fare or George Romero's original trilogy (even though he was rumored to direct/write the first installment, only to be turned away), but there has been worse Zombie films and Jovovich does do a good job playing the lead.<br /><br />As for this new re-release combo of the first two films, I was expecting the cheap way out with maybe the original '02 release one discer of the first movie packaged with the Disc One of the sequel. But surprisingly that's not the case. The discs in this set are a brand new piece, with Disc One having BOTH movies on the same DVD-9 single sided, dual layer disc. This was very cool, with a brand new menu with one movie per layer, with only two audio tracks (5.1 English/French). You'd expect that the bitrate would be very low for these movies, but since this was re-encoded in 2007, both movie's rate seem very high, and picture looking superb for SD. As for the second disc, it's a mixed bag. If you were expecting all the bonus features from the 2 Disc individual releases, forget it. Since this release was made just to promote the theatrical release of the third film, '07's somewhat disapointing Extinction, they mostly deal with sneak peeks of it. However, there are a few extras outside of Number Three, but they all deal with Apocalypse, so no behind-the-scenes of the original, not to mention the films themselves are missing their commentaries from those as well. There is a neat trivia game on Disc Two with some pretty hardcore questions on Apocalypse, but they could have easily given us more than what they did.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great way to get the first two films at a good price if all you're really looking for is the movies and a morsel of extras. As I write this, it's been a year since this was released and I doubt it will be in print for much longer due to Extinction now old news on DVD. But if you don't own the first two films and have interest in modern-day Zombies I'd suggest picking it up cheap, then if you really, really like the films, spend the extra buck and buy the extensive 2 Disc versions and with Extinction, or wait for a possible complete boxset in the future.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.0/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Resident Evil 2 has much of the same qualities as the first film did.  For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously.<br /><br />However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.<br /><br />Oh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all.<br /><br />Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In 2002, audiences and critics alike were surprised by the success of the video game inspired hit "Resident Evil".  Though critics and even some moviegoers didn't feel the movie was worthy of receiving a sequel, even though the ending was left wide open and a sequel was needed for some sort of resolution to the story, the studio execs were clearly listening to those that enjoyed the movie and decided to buck the critics and released "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  The same people that despised the first film were bashing the release of its sequel with just as much passion; however, upon it's release the film managed to silence many of its attackers.  Not settling for merely making a sequel for money alone, writer Paul W. S. Anderson (the writer/director of "Resident Evil") crafted an even bigger, better, and more action packed thriller for the follow-up, and succinctly silenced the nay-sayers with a sequel that ties up all loose ends from the original film, serving as an excellent addition to a budding franchise.<br /><br />"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" begins directly where "Resident Evil" left off, starting with a flashback sequence that serves as a refresher course for the audience so that all are on the same page when the action really gets going.  Surviving the zombie attacks in the underground compound of the Umbrella Corporation, Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Raccoon City, located right next to the compound, and discovers that she is too late.  The entire city has apparently been overrun by zombies, with most of the city in ruins, Alice begins searching for any non-infected survivors.  She finds a few companions that are willing to take the fight to the zombies, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), well-armed and ready for action these compatriots set out to rid Raccoon City of the evil unleashed by Umbrella Corporation.  However, Umbrella Corp. has a surprise for our heroes, a nasty mutated form of zombie known as Nemesis.  With supplies becoming drastically limited, it appears that time is running out for our heroes, and humanity's days could be numbered.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" is simply a better film than its predeccesor, in terms of acting, storytelling, pacing, and action.  To be fair, "Resident Evil" is merely the opening chapter to this much bigger story that is told in "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse", and in truth, neither of the two films hold up on their own.  Director Alexander Witt brings his valuable experience as a much respected 2nd Unit Director from his previous film experiences, "Gladiator" and "The Bourne Identity" to name a couple, giving the material a more mature, polished appearance that the original film lacked.  The special effects, including the practical and make-up effects, are all improved in "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  A very good decision was made in having the Nemesis monster not be just another CGI character, but be a physical man in a suit, it is with the Nemesis character that the make-up and practical effects team really shined.  The acting and storytelling were much improved from the original film, and the addition of Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera from the video games was an especially nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" is a very solid, zombie thriller that doesn't stand up well on it's own, but when coupled with the first film, the two make for a very entertaining thrill ride of zombie mayhem.<br /><br />"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>See this sequal<br /><br />it will blow you away like it did me<br /><br />I saw the trailer and was hooked<br /><br />it so is Rated R right<br /><br />it is so graphic I like had my eyes bugged out half of the time<br /><br />very good movie<br /><br />hope it got many awards<br /><br />a brilliant follow up to Resident Evil<br /><br />see this movie if you liked the first one<br /><br />claps alot* you go cast and everyone that made this<br /><br />can't wait for Resident Evil code Veronica whenever it comes out<br /><br />this will also stay a classic for horror movies for the next 100 and some years. I'm so watching this one over and over and over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Paul Anderson to me is a guy movie director: he doesn't make 3 hour long character studies or big period pieces, he just wants to have 90 minutes to show people kicking ass and blowing s*** up. Story may be very one dimensional, as are its characters, and dialogue may be hokey, but if I turned off my brain, I actually could enjoy this.<br /><br />Resident Evil the first film was essentially a prequel to the first Resident Evil game which took place in the Spencer mansion. The movie was written to provide a prologue to the game even though there's Resident Evil Zero but oh well.<br /><br />After the events of the first film, Alice, having woken up from some experiments done to her, she awakes to find Raccoon City looking decimated(kind of like RE2 and 3). Umbrella wants to know what happened in the Hive so they open it's huge doors, bad idea. The "zombies"(they're not called that in the films) attack the scientists and start to overrun the city. The city people then go to the city's only exit, but someone contracts the virus and turns into one of them. Umbrella decides that it's too dangerous to have the virus this close so they do the next best thing to get rid of it: nuke the city. What follows is a group of people trying to escape without getting infected or killed and rescuing the T-Virus creator's daughter.<br /><br />The plot is basically Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. There's no mention of William Birkin, Leon, or Claire. It does have Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine from RE3(the latter also being in the first game). Not an important thing but Jill is HOT. Oded Fehr plays Carlos with a badassness and Milla Jovovich is quite capable in the movie-only character Alice. The big creature is the Nemesis, who transformed from Matt from the first movie. He looks like the game's character and has a rocket launcher and mini-gun.<br /><br />Instead of Paul directing the sequel, the reins are given to Alexander Witt, a long-time second unit director but first time head director. He sometimes has a tendency to have the fast editing syndrome that plagues a director like Michael Bay with fast shots. This makes the fight with Alice and the Nemesis kind of weird too watch cause he's so damn slow yet it's shot like he's going Bruce Lee on her.<br /><br />They're making a 3rd one with Paul returning as director. Seeing as how Resident Evil 4 just very recently came out, I'm wondering how it'll have its plot turn out. And here's to having Claire, Chris, Ada and especially Rebecca in the next film. But as for this one, give it a shot since it won't do anything bad and may enjoy it(except if you think the movie sucks).</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Not oftern does a sequel surpass the first.  This IS one exception.  More characters from the game appear in this one, and there is a lot of action.  It's non-stop, a rollercoaster ride into hell and back.<br /><br />Cast performs well.  The critters are great.  In a year full of good zombie films, this one stands out on its own.  The plot is more complex than the first.  Project nemesis is in full throttle and our heroes now have a new enemy to battle as well as the flesh eating ghouls.  For horror fans, lotsa blood and goo.  For actioneers it's even better.  lottsa fun.  Eat popcorn, press play, enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>In "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse," Milla Jovovitch once again stars as the renegade security agent from the Umbrella Corporation.  This time around, we know her name - Alice.  In "Apocalypse," the deadly T-virus has escaped from the underground laboratory known as the Hive and threatens to destroy an entire metropolis, Raccoon City.  Alice has been injected with the T-virus and has become a mutated super hero.  She leads a handful of survivors in search of a scientist's lost daughter.  The scientist has promised to airlift them to safety before a nuclear bomb destroys Raccoon City.  Like the original "Resident Evil," this sequel is a science fiction/horror hybrid with non-stop action.  Instead of an underground lab, an entire city has been infected with the T-virus.  There are a thousand more zombies, killer dobermans, and hideoulsy mutated creatures that must be fought by a gorgeous cast of young actors/actresses.  A powerful rock-n-roll score accentuates the numerous action sequences.  While watching this movie, Euro horror fans will think of Lamberto Bava's "Demons" and "Demons 2" in which everyone is turning into hideous demons in lieu of zombies.  Favorite scene in "Apocalypse:"  When Alice crashes her motorcycle through a church's stained glass windown and battles the mutated creatures.  A very strong sequel that rivals the original, "Apocalypse" is an apocalyptic disaster movie.  If you own the original, you must own "Apocalypse."</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>Perhaps the only movie that could come in with lower expectations of an adaptation of a video game is the sequel to an adaptation of a video game.  Despite (or perhaps because of?) such low expectations, the movie was remarkably well done.  The twists and turns of the plot were interesting, and not 100% predictable.  There was advancement of the broader story line of the t-virus:  A bioweapon that happens to turn the infected into flesh eating zombies.  Sounds simplistic?  Well, the story has more to it than that.<br /><br />Even from a non-zombie afficianado, it was a sequel worth watching.  Not a Casblanca classic, but perhaps in 20 years this will still be watched as a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Extinction may be better than these two films but that doesn't prevent them from being excellent zombie movies with well-done storylines. I love the action and Milla Jovovich is hot and graceful when slaughtering hordes of the undead. The creature designs  are excellent too. These movies are something any zombie movie fan cannot miss out on. There are some issues, such as the lack of gore and some cheesy sequences in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Other than these you will be amazed at how creative a zombie movie can be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>thought its ok slipt in the middle about it, it had its moment of good scenes but i have seen worst when they are doing sequels</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>I'll admit, when I first saw they were going to be making "Resident Evil" into a movie I thought it was going to be horrible.  Now that the second installment is out I have to say I am more then just a fan and am eagerly awaiting for the third movie to come out.<br /><br />Apocalypse picks up right where the first one left off.  Racoon City is being sealed off as the virus can't be contained.  Alice and a handful of others must find a high ranking scientist's daughter who didn't make it out of the city.  The ending leaves you wanting more as well.<br /><br />Filled with action, and much more exciting plot (still you must see Resident Evil prior to this one), Apocalypse delievers one wild ride of a movie.  A must own for any fan of the game or great Sci-Fi movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>People, if you want fleshed out characters and other cinematic niceties, why on earth would you even watch a movie like this?  It's meant to be an adrenaline rush, a cavalcade of fights and wow special effects.  Who cares about Alice's past?  We get enough from the first movie to fill us in.  This movie delivers what you should expect from this kind of moviemaking.  Milla Jovovich kicks butt in this one, which I think overall is better than the original, which seemed to be nothing more than an extended video game.  This time around we get Alice paired up with the likes of Mike Epps, Oded Fehr, Sienna Guillory and others.  Thomas Krestchmann who was so good in THE PIANIST makes an interesting villain.  There's lots of explosive action and twists and turns.  Its dark ending squeals for a third installment.  So relax enjoy this movie's mindlessness and appreciate the craft that was necessary to pull it off so nicely.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Milla Jovovich's character from the first is back in Resident Evil Apocalypse. The first one ends with her and another survivor being taking in and genitcally altered. Which makes Jovovich a hell of a lot quicker and stronger. The plot in the sequel has her and other survivors stuck in Racoon city with zombies all over the place. A scientist says he can get them out of the city if they find his lost daugher there.<br /><br />  There's tons of action in the movie and Jovovich is in great action form. The movie isn't anywhere near as being a good of a zombie movie as 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead or even....Shaun of the Dead. It's still fun though and even better than the first. I think critics such as Ebert & Roeper were way too hard on the movie. It ends making it obvious that a part 3 will be coming soon. Although I liked it, Dawn of the Dead ended making me wanna see more. Resident Evil Apocalypse's ending didn't really make me care whether there's another one or not. Then again part one's ending didn't make me wanna see more either...</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I didn't care for the first one. I thought it was too slow. This one however revived the series. As the rating board says on the movie, in fine print under the R rating "Non stop violence and gore" need I say more?<br />It was a very good movie. My only problem is I hate matrix type movies and James bond type of movies, meaning: Impossible feats that not only leave you saying "yea right" but also are so outrageous they are laughable at best. Ex: she runs down a building on a rope. I thought that was not only impossible, but way cheesy. Movies need to stay away from the Charlie's angels mentality! You begin to stop taking it seriously when you see too much of this. Another nit-pick I have is the fast camera battle sequences. ITS ANNOYING! we all know the scenes. Where the camera moves so fast all you here is grunts from the battle, and a snippet of gore. Hold the camera still you moron!<br />Anyway, awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>The chorus goes "Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!" Well you get the idea.<br /><br /> REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.<br /><br /> Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.<br /><br /> What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches. This one's not even worth playing MST3K to.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>I got suckered in, I'll admit it. I kept telling myself that the sequel will be better than the original. But it wasn't. The plot was all over the place and there were just too many predictable moments followed by a useless need to just deliver action without a comprehendable story. It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?' It just gets repeatative. What results is a movie that could have been better but failed to even make par. Better luck next time, guys. And if that isn't enough, there's a hint that there might be another sequel. Oh brother is all I have to say. The only thing that saved this movie was the fact that it had a lot of good cinematograpghy and style. Also, the token black guy was hilarious throughout the whole movie. But, trust me on this folks, rent it. Don't buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I liked the first "Resident Evil" better.  I liked the way it opened and the entire idea of people having to go back into the Hive to find out what happened and look for survivors.  There is something to be said for the inherent tension in having to keep going forward when you should be turning around and getting the hell out of Dodge as quick as possible.  "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is about the getting the hell out of Dodge, or in this case Raccoon City, but there is a major problem in terms of the as quick as possible part, especially given that the city is about to be nuked.<br /><br />The Umbrella Corporation decided to reopen the Hive, which allows the T-virus to escape and turn the inhabitants of Raccoon City into zombies.  I might be slow when it comes to modern science, but I really fail to see the practical applications or economic potential of the T-virus given that it is not really regeneration human cells.  Now the nuke option is making a lot of sense, which is bad news for Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically created ultimate fighting machine, who is trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombies to safety.  But since this movie is based on a video game, things get worse.  The Umbrella Corporation sends Nemesis, a killing machine that may or may not be a genetically mutated version of Alice's boyfriend, Matt, from the previous film.  Apparently shooting people before nuking them is in the best interest of the corporation.  Go figure.<br /><br />Alice at least has some decent allies this time around, with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a demoted cop who is pretty good given that she has no genetic enhancements, and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who leads what is left of an elite tactical team.  Weather reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) is as close as we get to the damsel in distress with this group, and she is not stupid.  The group has a glimmer of hope in that there is a scientist, Dr. Asher (Jared Harris), who created the T-virus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the "easy" through zombie town.  All they have to do is rescue his daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), who was left behind.  So this is the "Resident Evil" equivalent of trying to get out of zombie town with one hand tied behind your back.<br /><br />I understand that there are a lot of things in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" that are lifted from the various "Resident Evil" video games, but all of that is lost on me.  I am sure that this adds another dimension of enjoyment to the film, just like when I watch a "Spider-Man" movie and talk about what shots are taken from which cover by which artist.  A lot of this stuff is explained in the various commentary tracks, so there is ample opportunity to play catch-up, but it would all work a lot better if you have actually seen the video games.  The bad news is that the sequel seems much more like a video game as the survivors fight zombies, and then they fight mutant creatures, and then they fight the Umbrella Corp., and then they go through the whole cycle again.<br /><br />Taking the movie out of the Hive and up to the streets works against the tension and the terror, even when you throw in the zombie strippers (yeah, it sounds like a good idea, but it really is not).  I think the characters are more interesting this time, mainly because their collective competence level is a lot higher than the first film, but this is yet another film that turns the lights down low and edits like crazy to achieve its effects.  I am so sick and tired of movies resorting to that approach instead of just letting us see what is going on.  But this is a movie that really does not have much respect for the intelligence of its audience, all of whom would know to shot zombies wearing body armor in the head.  At least the movie makes the videogames look really good in comparison, so there is that.  You just have to be into playing the games.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent.  It looked like it was recorded digitally, it looked so good, and I'm sure it was.  It appeared to be presented in 2.40:1, so there were black bars at the top and bottom, which is how I prefer movies to be.<br /><br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 was about the best sound I have ever heard.  There was also PCM 5.1, but no DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, or Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack had better surround sound than most DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Blu-Rays.  Lot's of sub-woofer bass also.<br /><br />The movie itself was just okay.  Lot's of action, violence, and blood & guts. I was glad it was only 1 hour and 27 minutes long.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is the second film in what is so far a four-film franchise, and it takes the first movie and ramps it up by several notches. And, cripes, that T-Virus sure is a real mother. The sitch as this sequel opens is this: a zombie plague has scoured Raccoon City, thanks to the ill dealings of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's largest pharmaceutical agency and just possibly the most diabolical global entity, like, ever. Precautions have been taken. Raccoon City has been entirely sealed off, the sun setting on a population left to fend for itself, probably feed on itself. Throughout the city, measures have been taken to ensure the evacuation of Umbrella Corporation's key personnel. The scientist who invented the T-Virus, for one, gets out safely. But his young daughter doesn't. At sunrise, Raccoon City is scheduled for a tactical nuclear strike. Some really heavy sunscreen is recommended.<br /><br />The story tracks a tiny band of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to escape the city limits. It helps that this group is made up primarily of highly skilled operatives from the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit and also from an Umbrella strike force. It also helps that the scientist who invented the T-virus is willing to guide them to safety, provided they rescue his young child. The odds for survival increase dramatically with the arrival of Alice, former head of security for an underground Umbrella complex. But it's a slightly different Alice than from what we remember in the first movie. She's been experimented on by the Umbrella think tank and she now demonstrates super powers. Another survivor from the first movie figures in APOCALYPSE, except that he'd been tweaked and probed and genetically engineered into becoming the terrifying Nemesis program. And no surprise that even with a city apocalypse going down, there are still fiendish Umbrella asshats bent on pursuing their messed-up experiments - such as pitting the Nemesis Program and Alice against each other, in a backstreet brawl, just to see who'd come out on top.<br /><br />Plot, sphlot. This is survival horror cinema, so one shouldn't expect too much verisimilitude or texture. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE was designed with crunching zombie kills and gory special effects in mind. Sexy Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr step into the fray as two uber-capable action heroes in their own right. But Milla Jovovich owns this franchise, and she again lends her fantastic looks and her palpable physicality. Milla is fearless when it comes to committing to her action sequences, and she performs a lot of her own stunts, including rappelling 60 feet down the side of a high rise edifice. She really anchors the film, drives most of the spectacular action set pieces.<br /><br />Plenty of gamers complained that the first film strayed too far from the video game, and here's APOCALYPSE attempting to atone. Consequently, game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory), Carlos Olivera (Fehr), and Nicholai Ginovaef are introduced, and the hulking Nemesis program is the featured Big Bad. The character of Alice was, of course, originally invented for the film franchise. The lickers are back, as are the gore hounds. Plenty for our good guys to shoot to bits. And, as ever, no dearth of the shambling undead, including a pack of flesh-eating school children.<br /><br />Mike Epps provides the comedy relief, but you should watch the movie anyway.<br /><br />What I have is the 2-DVD Special Edition with tons of bonus material. Disc one has the feature presentation with the option to view it in either wide or full screen and three audio commentary tracks (including one with actors Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Milla Jovovich and Milla's unfortunate cackling - and they sure make fun of Germans a lot). Disc 2 has: 20 forgettable deleted scenes, 12 minutes worth; cast outtakes; "Game Over: RESIDENT EVIL Reanimated" - a six-part "Making Of" the film (focusing respectively on the stunts, the zombie choreography (the Undead Boot Camp), the sets, the weapons used, and the visual f/x); "Game Babes" explores the emergence of female action stars in cinema, showcasing Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory; "Corporate Malfeasance" is a featurette focusing on how the Umbrella Corporation bears real world similarities; "Symphony of Evil" is  a special effects montage; "Poster Gallery" showcases five submissions from the finalists of the online poster design contest; and there are movie trailers, including the theatrical trailer and teaser for RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE and the trailer for RESIDENT EVIL.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Apocalypse may not be as good as the other two Resident Evil movies, but it's still a rather exceptional zombie-horror/action film. This is a zombie film that is definitely worth checking out for any zombie movie fan.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Raccoon City has been completely overrun by the zombies infected with the deadly T-Virus. The Umbrella Corporation can no longer contain the infection and have now sealed off the the city and will not let anyone else leave and plan to nuke the city off the face of the earth to kill the virus and not let it spread. So a group of people Alice (the main protagonist with mysterious powers and abilities she received through the T-Virus), Carlos Olivera ( A member of the S.T.A.R.S. unit who was left behind by the corporation and became freelance), Jill Valentine (A sexy, unapologetic, police officer), LJ (A criminal who was released from prison when the infection broke out), and Angela Ashford (A little girl who's father created the T-Virus and she has the virus) must go rescue Angela Ashford for her father in exchange for giving them directions to a helicopter which would be the last transportation out of the city before it gets nuked. So they must avoid zombies and the terrifying Nemesis; an abomination armed with a mini-gun and a rocket launcher; who specifically goes out and kills S.T.A.R.S. members and tries to kill Alice as part of a sick kill-or-be-killed survival game planned by the Umbrella Corporation. Alice also has visions of memories of what the Umbrella Corporation did to her after they took her and an environmentalist named Matt from the Spencer Mansion after the first outbreak and experiment on them and cover up what happened in The Hive.<br />MUSIC: The music sets the mood, and has adrenaline rush to it at times during the hectic shoot-a-thon scenes between Alice and the Nemesis or during encounters with zombies and other creatures. I especially love the song played in the credits by Killswitch Engage (The End of Heartache).<br />GORE FACTOR: This movie along with the first one really lack in this area, thank God, the storyline and action scenes make up for it.<br />ACTION: Sometimes the hand-to-hand combat gets cheesy during some scenes which also damages the quality of the movie. But the shooting scenes and zombie action really make this a polished zombie-horror/action flick.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: This film is very entertaining and the storyline will really keep you interested and willing to follow it through every plot-twist and character development. It's a real treat for people who love zombie films and action films and is definitely worth more than just a rental.<br />OVERALL: It may lack gore and the hand-to-hand combat may get a little cheesy and disappointing, but the storyline and action really make up for most of those flaws.<br />THE GOOD: Great shooting scenes, cool zombie and creature designs, great story, cool characters, and Milla Jovovich is hot.<br />THE BAD: Lack of gore and some fighting scenes are cheesy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Anyone who has watched "The Claim," with Milla Jovavich, and then the "Resident Evil," movies, would have to shake their head a few times and say, Is this the same actress?  Well, yes it is.  And I like both.  In the Claim, a retelling of Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, you see MJ give a performance that should of at least netted her an academy award nomination (and she can sing!).  But the Academy, being the sink hole it now is, ignored that wonderful movie and the performances in it.  Fast forward things a few years, and Milla is kicking tail in better than Tomb Raider style.  A business decision on MJ's part?  Who knows?  But Hollywood can be cruel to women as they age.  For my money, it's clear MJ can do anything, and if B-movie Superchick is her choice, then enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of movie that critics hate, and movie goers love.  It's fast, it's furious, and don't try to make much sense of it (Example: the motorcycle crashing through the church window.  But hey!  It LOOKED great!).  Devil dogs, zombies (very lame ones, who fail the Romero zombie shuffle test), evil corporate scientists, and a band of heros out to save a little girl.  That's all you probably need to know.  This particular chapter of the RE series is probably closer than the original as far as aping the game, with various moments in various rooms where something hideous awaits.  As genre work, this movie is pretty good, with one star missing due to zombies being used as only background noise.

Didn't do a very good job of doing that.<br /><br />The fools from Umbrella Corp. unleash the dead in the hive, and now the T-Virus is spreading through out Raccoon City. Citizens cannot leave the city, and now are trapped with the walking dead.<br /><br />Jovovich returns as the dull and boring Alice, who now has super powers like a fake ass Albert Wesker wannabee from Code Veronica X. Along trapped in Raccoon City is Jill Valentine (Guillory), a reporter (Holt), 2 Umbrella soldiers (Fehr, Ward), a citizen (Epps) and a few others I don't care mentioning.<br /><br />On their tales is a killing maching called Nemesis (Taylor). Once again, no gore, dull characters, and boring Alice taking away the spoylight from real characters from the game. Nemesis is a weak sissy in this film, and he looks cheesey. Nicholai in the game is a old and evil man. In this movie, Nicholai is a young man on the good guys' side.<br /><br />The slow-motion scenes of the zombies' walking looks stupid, and once again, these zombies are pitiful. This film does have a few good scenes, good fight scenes, and the ending isn't bad. However, it's just like the first film...disappointing.<br /><br />Resident Evil really needs to be redone soon. And when I mean redone, I mean no Anderson, no Screen Gems, and no Alice. At least these Resident Evil films are good for one thing...they entertain.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>John Huston once said that a good story should have "excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony". Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse". What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.<br /><br />The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching "Beauty and the Beast" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.<br /><br />The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.<br /><br />Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads.  Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's "Zoolander" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in "Dummy" than she does in her "Resident Evil-Apocalypse" outfits.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Apocalypse" picks up right where this first "Resident Evil" left off.  In fact, it backtracks a bit to explain how the ending of the first came about.  And then, we are off, as Alice (Jovovich) hooks up with some others (Guillory, Holt, Fehr) trapped in the city.  The city has been locked down because the virus from the first movie has gotten out of the Hive.  The group is offered assistance in getting out if they can find and rescue the daughter of an Umbrella Corp. employee.  Added incentive comes in the form of a nuclear cleansing of the city that is on its way.  Along the way, they will deal with zombies, more of the creatures from the first movie, and the Nemesis (a really big, ugly mutant with a creepy smile).<br /><br />"Apocalypse" falls short of the confined terror of the first film.  The underground nature of the original added to the rising tension, while here the players have the run of the city.  Plus, to some extent, there is not much new here.  The Nemesis is a creepy adversary, but he introduced fairly early on, and his eventual end is no surprise, given the events of the first film.  There is also another cliffhanger of sorts at the end to set up another sequel.<br /><br />Chances are, if you liked the first film, you will like this one as well.  If you did not like the first one or avoided it completely, you would be better off looking elsewhere for entertainment.  What you think you will get out of this film is exactly what you will get.  I liked it, but only enough to recommend on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has more actions, to be sure, but the film itself is done with less creativity and originality, repeating what you have seen in other better films featuring the un-deads, or zombies.  (The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')  And as to the actions, some must be really good -- I say 'must' because many scenes are poorly directed and edited, with a camerawork that shows the director doens't know how to create exciting fighting sequences, whether they are martial arts or bullet shootings.<br /><br />Sorry if I sound harsh, but don't say I am missing the point.  I know the film is based on a Capcom game, and I know the story is only an excuse for the heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich who returned from the original) who must fight against a lots of zombies, in Racoon City which always looks like Toronto.  I'm not complaining about it.<br /><br />Anyway, the Umbrella Corp. very strong company cause the infection of deadly virus that spread all over the city (which has only one bridge to access there), and it should be contained immediately.  Many citizens are turned zombies, who attack the following hapless people -- Beside Alice, tough (suspended) cop Jill (Sienna Guillory, 'Love Actually'), soldier Carlos (Oded Fehr 'The Mummy'), small-time crook LJ (Mike Epps, 'Friday'), newsreporter Terri (Sandrine Holt).  Plus you see Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') who controls the military operation ruthlessly.<br /><br />If you can ignore the numerous plot holes and inconsistent logics, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has serious problems with it.  As I said, the fighting sections, which should be the biggest feature of the film, suffer heavily from the inept editing that use too many fast cuts and slanted camera.  Milla Jovovich, physically fit, is fine as the fighting heroine, but the camera fails to capture the essence of her, which was so eloquently shown in 'The Fifth Element.'<br /><br />To make matters worse, though Milla is as beautiful as ever, the film's confusing (and unfocused) plot somehow refuses to use her to the full.  In fact, you don't see Alice on screen for considerable time, as the film heavy-handedly introduces other characters into the story.  And the way it does is so confusing that you find the film repetitive -- see how many times you have to see some people biting others, which causes inevitable results.  Many have already seen the consequence in the original, so once is fine.  Twice is unnecessary.<br /><br />There are good things, though.  Sienna Guillory is a standout as the strong-willed police officer, whose acting is perhaps better than the star Milla Jovovich.  Perhaps her roles was cut short (especially the earlier part) because some of her behaviors in the opening parts look too adrupt.  They should not have done that (if they did, I mean).  And Mike Epps gives us a few moments of genuine laughs, which are always welcome to me.<br /><br />But as a whole 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a bit disappointment, because of its recycled ideas and mediocre actions.  What if Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote the script, but went to direct 'Alien vs Predator') directed this?  I don't know, but perhaps, just perhaps, made it more effective than Alexander Witt, who was the second director for pefectly choleographed 'Pirates of the Carribians.'</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>These movies were both good sci-fi/ action/ horror movies that are still inferior to the Blade trilogy. So if you want to have the best sci-fi/ horror movies of the 2, Blade's better. If you want to have the classic, check out the Alien Quadrilogy, but if you just want to have some fun, buy this set. They're both good, solid movies with good suspense and great action and special effects.<br /><br />Resident Evil (# 1) is about a group of soldiers that must destroy a virus before it has a deadly effect on the world.<br /><br />Resident Evil Apocalypse- Alice played by Mila Jockavich has to help fight the undead and has to rescue a missing girl.<br /><br />Both movies have good action scenes where you'll be like:" wow! That was cool!!" but the 2nd one is better with better action and more memorable stuff. I recommend them as rents to everyone and buys for absolute die hard funs. You'll just have a good time watching them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>I have to admit I loved the first film.  It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied.  Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events.  There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality.  I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel.  As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood.  Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place.  More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story.  A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, cliched characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.<br /><br />To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original.  I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation.  I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich&eacute; instead.  The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse.  His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top).  Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first.  There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall).  This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series.  Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film.  Yet again, who am I to say?  Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end.  It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.<br /><br />The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clich&eacute;s to pour in like the flood gates had been opened.  The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present.  The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold.  The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever.  Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas.  YUK.  Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing.  Not just the characters were clich&eacute;, but also the story.  Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI.  Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load.  Seriously, I would love to know what happened.<br /><br />I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.  For any of you that did not, I question your sanity.  The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut.  It was sloppy and cheap.  Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.<br /><br />Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series.  The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad.  Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is great! Better than the original, more action, more style. Stylish, superb, and dynamic. This is the second zombie picture this year after "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & fourth zombie picture of 2002-2004. Included in that list is "28 Days Later" (2003) & the original "Resident Evil" (2002). It is the third best zombie picture of 2002-2004, behind "28 Days Later" (2003) & "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004). Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, one of the two survivors of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), send to check something that went wrong in the hive hidden underneath Raccoon City, who is now trying to find a way to escape the city. Jovovich's performance is excellent, an improvement on her original performance for "Resident Evil" (2002). The cast is very promising. Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, a rogue member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), looking for a way to get out of the city, as well. Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, one of three soldiers trapped in the city. Thomas Kretschmann as Major Cain, the commander of the command center in the safe zone and one of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. Sophie Vavasseur as Angie Ashford, daughter of Dr. Charles Ashford, a doctor whose research was used for biological weaponry, who is missing somewhere in the city. Razaaq Adoti as Peyton Wells, a friend of Jill's and a member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S). Jared Harris as Dr. Ashford, the doctor of whose research was used for biological weaponry and whose daughter is missing somewhere in the city. Mike Epps as L.J., a man whose in the right place at the wrong time. Sandrine Holt as Terri Morales, a reporter lost in the city looking for her big break. Matthew G. Taylor as Nemesis, the second survivor of Alice's elite group, whose real name is Matt Addison, who was transformed into Umbrella Corp's new creation. Zack Ward as Nicholai Sokolov, the second of the three soldiers trapped in the city and Olivera's right-hand man. Iain Glen as Dr. Isaacs, second of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. This is an excellent zombie pic in between "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & "Resident Evil" (2002). The directing by Alexander Witt (who was the cinematographer for "Hollywood Homicide" (2002), whose taking over for Paul W.S. Anderson, who produced and wrote the story and screenplay for this one, is excellent. The story and screenplay by Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote, produced, & directed the original "Resident Evil" (2002), and who also directed "Mortal Kombat" (1995), "Event Horizon" (1997) & "Soldier" (1998), who recently wrote and directed "Alien Vs. Predator" (2004) is excellent. The music by Jeff Danna (who also did the music to "O" (2001), with additional music by Elia Cmiral (who also did the music for "Ronin" (1998) & "Stigmata" (1999), "Wrong Turn" (2003), "They" (2002) "Bones" (2001) and also orchestrated the score to "Bones" (2001), is excellent. The cinematography by Derek Rogers & Christian Sebaldt is excellent. The film editing by Eddie Hamilton is excellent. Casting by Tina Gerussi (who did the casting for "Chicago" (2002), "Good Will Hunting" (1997) "Dracula 2000" (2000) & Robyn Ray (who did the casting for the original "Resident Evil" (2002), "She's All That" (1999), "Dracula 2000" (2000), & "Searching For Bobby Fischer" (1993) is excellent. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry (who production designed "Exit Wounds" (2001), "The Tuxedo" (2002), recently, "Highwaymen" (2004) & upcoming, "Assault On Precinct 13" (2005) and was also the art director of "X-Men" (2000) & "The Corruptor" (1999) is excellent. The art direction by Nigel Churcher (who was the assistant art director for "Frequency" (2000), second assistant art director, graphics, for "The Virgin Suicides" (1999) & assistant art director for "Bait" (2000) & third assistant art director for "Romeo & Juliet" (1996) & also directed the art for "Driven" (2001), "The Tuxedo" (2002), recently, "Highwaymen" (2004) & upcoming, "Assault On Precinct 13" (2005) is excellent. The set decoration by Steven Essam (who set decorated "Honey" (2003), "Paid In Full" (2002) & the upcoming "Assault On Precinct 13" (2005) is excellent. The costume design by Mary E. McLeod (who costume designed "Porky's" (1982), "Porky's II: The Next Day" (1983), "A Christmas Story" (1983), "3000 Miles To Graceland" (2001) & "Driven" (2001) & Adam Smith, who did the costuming to Nemesis, is excellent. The make-up effects on Nemesis and the rest of the zombies are excellent. A good sequel to its original movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.<br /><br />This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.<br /><br />These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of "White Rabbit" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.<br /><br />In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.<br /><br />This second film is, in my opinion, marginally better than the first film.  It feels less tied to the strict gameplay narrative that hobbled the first film.  On the other hand, I really didn't like the feel of Raccoon City in it.  It never really came to feel like a real place.  It just felt like a succession of sets, whether indoor or outdoor.  Contrast this with THE MATRIX, where the city of the construct felt much more alive and actual.<br /><br />I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.<br /><br />For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This second in the trilogy is good, but as many of my friends warned me, not as good as the first.  You have the zombies, demon dogs, etc. as well as a monster who has 'very familiar eyes', but it seems a little dark and shadowy, which seems to rob it of some intensity. It feels more spooky than action packed. Perhaps because they're still stuck in the city fighting in and out of the buildings it just seems too cramped, and too much like the first. I did like it though and it's good enough to stand on its own without watching the first in the series.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.<br /><br />Anyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are wont to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.<br /><br />To give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)<br /><br />Performances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.<br /><br />As if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.<br /><br />Also, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.<br /><br />Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Apocalypse (Alexander Witt, 2004)<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse may be Alexander Witt's first directorial credit, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more than enough experience under his belt to direct an action flick. His previous credits include work on such things-blow-up-nicely movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, XXX, Gladiator, and Lethal Weapon 3. So you can go into Apocalypse knowing you're going to get, at least, a solid action flick.<br /><br />Then you take a look at the cast. Milla Jovovich returns, of course, but much of the rest of the cast are also known for solid action-film work; there's Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Jared Harris (b.Monkey), Sienna Guillory (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Razaaq Adoti (Black Hawk Down), and Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason), among others. Getting away from action films, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe) and Mike Epps (Strays) also jump out of the cast. So you know you have a well-acted solid action flick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's all you get. It's really kind of depressing that one of the few games actually capable of scaring you if played in the right conditions doesn't actually merit a horror film, but there you go. Jovovich reprises her role from the first film, and is here backed up by game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Fehr). The basic plot of the movie is that the three of them, along with a changing roster of hangers-on, have to both survive the city's undead and get out of the now-quarantined Raccoon City for reasons that the viewer's clued into about halfway through the movie. The result, as noted in the rating, is non-stop violence.<br /><br />Given that, it's surprising how well the film does work on that level. The situation is quite likely to remind you of Predator, arguably the best film Schwarzenegger ever made (and definitely the best film Gov. Ventura ever made); Apocalypse suffers in comparison because the characters don't have anywhere near as much depth, but the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun. I just wish it had more of the outright creepy feel that made Resident Evil 2 (the game) so wonderful. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing this film and it was way better than I thought it would be. I thought the first Resident Evil was okay, but Apocalypse is an even better action/horror film. This movie really flies by with an action scene occuring about every five minutes or so. This film is not brain candy, but eye candy like this is always a treat to me. The action scenes are well done even though the gore is tamed down a bit (don't worry there is still blood and tons of violence). Milla Jovovich returns and really plays Alice tough, yet sexy at the same time. Who would have thought a skinny model would make a great female action star? Sienna Guillory is even sexier in my opinion as Jill Valentine and I'll look forward to seeing more of her in the third RE film. Oded Fehr is a pretty good actor and will have you rooting for him and Mike Epps steals the show with some funny lines. I'd say almost everybody in the theater I saw it with seemed to say good things about it as they were walking out. I really didn't expect to like it that much, but I truly had a great time. I think it is just as good as the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead and the improved CGI over the crummier effects of the first film is a big plus as well. A must see on the BIG screen for all action fans who want to see two attractive female leads kick butt!</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a gargantuan bomb of a movie and why do you ask is beacause it is just plain horrible. Bad writing, acting and the action set pieces are mind numbingly crappy and non exciting. This sequel takes place right after the original in the desolate town of Racoon City where the virus has spread even more and the inhabitants become zombies. Just like the first one this suffers but the first one was a notch better in my mind. Starring Mill Jovovich (Resident Evil, The Fifth Element), Oded Fehr (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns), Mike Epps (Next Friday, Friday After Next), Jared Harris (I Shot Andy Warhol, Igby Goes Down) and Alan Tudyk (28 Days, Tv's Firefly). I hated everything about this movie and the Nemesis creature was laugh out loud funny. This bored the hell out of me. I gotta say this goes down the line for being so retarded like Van Helsing was. The chick who played Jill Valentine and the others sprouted some awful dialouge. "im good but not that good" please. For die hard fans of Resident Evil but beware, these people dont know how to make a good movie if it bit them in the ass. I don't really care what other's say..hey, at least I got some taste. This movie is for no-brainers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>When I first rented the original "Resident Evil" I was completely shocked at how much I liked it.  I had zero expectations for it, yet was sucked in by it's story, characters and visualisation.  So I ran out and purchased it (as soon as it was on sale).  Since then I've watched it about 10 times, which is pretty remarkable considering I have roughly 350 DVDs to choose from.  Given this, as a non-gamer, I was surprised to find that gamers were generally disappointed in this movie (not all of them, but most negative reviews were from gamers).<br /><br />Now we have "Resident Evil- Apocalypse".  Don't get to see "grown-up" movies at the theater, so I had to wait until the DVD release.  I liked the first so much, I did not even think of renting this.  I quickly bought the DVD (when it went on sale, never buy at full price)with much anticipation.  Roughly 3 years later I have viewed it approximately (well, ACTUALLY)1 time.  That's right, no type-o.  JUST ONCE.  It was not nearly as compelling as the first film (to me).  Gone was the gripping story, the great camera work, the excellent character development.  In the stead of this great stuff was some sort of "made-for-cable" goofy monster movie.  Now, I did not hate it, (I actually like goofy monster movies) but it is not begging me to watch it again.  It's so in-your-face that after one viewing, there was nothing left to see.  No mystery.  No subtlety.  No sense of future dread. It was done.<br /><br />But wow!  Gamers really like it!!  Now it all makes sense.  Since I find shooter games extremely redundant and difficult to play more than once, I found this movie to be the same.  A one timer (OK maybe 2). Kind of like sixth sense.  Once you get to the end, well..  ...it's over.<br /><br />Cinematically, comparing this to the first film is like comparing the first "Star Wars" to the last (I'm talking release dates, not "Lucas-Time").  It's comparing something that is a carfully thought out and woven tale, to something that is simply a series of events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.  You travel down a linear path and take on what's in front of you.  Unfortunatly this is a film!<br /><br />I can't say don't buy this if you liked the first.  It's nice to have a continuation of the first.  Just don't go in with the same expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Milla Jovavich is back as @$$kicking Alice in the sequel to 2002's `Resident Evil'.  In `Apocalypse' we are given more of the same but it doesn't seem to really perform as well as the first film.  The sets aren't as exciting or as memorable, and the inclusion of Nemeses may excite some it left me a bit stale.  Milla is still as great and as fun as ever, and new to the game stars like Sienna Guillory (who plays video game favorite Jill Valentine) and Oded Fehr do a fine job of supporting her but the real stars are the CGI effects which work well for the most part.  Expect lots of action and lots of blood but with Michelle Rodriguez's snappy Rain missing and the lack of originality found in the first `Resident Evil' film `Apocalypse' just isn't strong enough to warrant it's own following.  Maybe three's a charm.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.<br /><br />The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.<br /><br />The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>I'll make this short and sweet, This is a very good movie but it should of been beter.The acting was OK of corse the story was great  and the fight seens were ok.THE PROBLEM, The problem with Resident Evil Apocalypse is that the camera views are awful.When you watch a fight seen you want to see the fight at a good angle and on many different angles.The views were so bad it's almost hard to describe them  but think about seeing a fight seen and the whole time the camera's focused on the person's chest the entire fight there's kicking and punching but you can't see much of the kicking or punching.SO GO See the movie if you love the game series or want to know the second part of the story, the movie wont let you down completely but those camera views are gonna start to get to you while watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,<br /><br />any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this case<br /><br />however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the<br /><br />viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.<br /><br />Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I think that I like this movie more than the original, but the original is still great. What is really good about this movie that makes it better than the first movie is the obvious return of characters we know from the video game series. It is great to see Carlos, Jill and the coolest of all, Nemesis in this movie.<br /><br />There are many times in this film that make references to the games. It was fun watching and saying, "Oh that was on Code Veronica!" for example. The acting was once again really good, but the action and special effects really make this a fun movie to watch. IF you love the first movie, then you should like this one. Especially if you know the series and know the game references that are made.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie was so bad it made me angry. Angry because it should be scary. But this director doesn't even try for horror. He goes for action and he fails at that too. The problem is, this is a director who simply doesn't know how to make a movie. What's the movie about? I'll tell you. There's this super woman, this group of people, a mad scientist and a monster guy and they all run around shooting stuff. There, you don't need to see it now. My favorite scene is when this super sexed up cop enters a room with a little girl and there are zombies in the room and the girl is scared but the cop says not to worry because the zombies are slow and they can just run right around them. HAHAHAHA! That takes any kind of threat out of zombies right there. End the movie now. But no. It drags on through this plot that makes absolutely no sense. Somebody explain to me what the point is of scientists making two monster people and making them battle each other. There's no suspense in this movie, no drama, horrible acting, so-so special effects and no story what so ever.<br /><br />And it's sad because the Resident Evil games are known to be the scariest games out there. So what the heck is up with this movie?</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I have on many occasions docked a set a star for absurd pricing.  For instance, most of the STAR TREK sets are subject to this -- though I must add that as I write this review all of the STAR TREK boxes have had their prices dropped down to prices that are actually affordable (if the prices were permanent instead of merely for a month or two, I would probably start collecting some of my favorite series) -- but this is the first time that I can recall giving a disc a star for bargain pricing.  If you have any interest at all in RESIDENT EVIL, they've priced this as a level where you can hardly refuse buying it.<br /><br />If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.<br /><br />This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.<br /><br />These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descension into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of "White Rabbit" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.<br /><br />In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.<br /><br />I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>If you dug the first Resident Evil film, you'll most likely dig Resident Evil: Apocalypse even more.  Taking place right after the end of the first film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself allied with a few survivors as they try to escape Raccoon City and the unending zombie onslaught.  Paul W.S. Anderson, who had directed the first film, wrote this sequel which is capably directed by first timer Alexander Witt.  The bigger budget allows for better special effects, a more expansive environment, and the appearance of fan favorite video game monster Nemesis.  Video game characters Jill (the oh so hot Sienna Guillory) and Carlos (The Mummy's Oded Fehr) are introduced, and the solid cast is rounded out by Mike Epps, Jared Harris, and Thomas Kretschmann.  However, Apocalypse is really nothing too special, and at times it is quite predictable, although the twist ending is a nice touch, and the door is left open (again) to another sequel.  It's not a waste of film as Roger Ebert described it as upon it's release, but it will depend on the viewer whether or not this is worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>I like it a little bit more than the original.

Having said that, I think it's fair to say that a movie sequel should have at least *something* that distinguishes it from the first one. Something that spices up the overall story and yet maintains a continuity. Well, you won't see that with "Resident Evil: Apocalypse." Alexander Witt sat in the director's chair for this one, but he may as well change his name to Paul Anderson, because this movie is basically a recycled, watered-down pointless sequel to the first one. Witt brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This might as well just be an hour and a half long prologue to "Resident Evil." Judged on its own merits, this one sinks faster than a ball of lead thrown in a river.<br /><br />To begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more "hip." Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one "shoot 'em up" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called "scary" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the "Nemesis" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.<br /><br />For me, the only enjoyable thing was seeing Milla Jovovich, whom I worship. She's perfect in her role as Alice. But as much as I love you Milla, even you couldn't save it.<br /><br />Bottom line: "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is an overly-loud, pointless, cliched, virtually plotless, poorly directed carbon-copy of the first movie, and at least the first one had its moments. Now, I'm a movie-goer who's able to have realistic expectations when walking into the theater. The "Resident Evil" movies are based on a video game for teenagers, so I'm not expecting "Citizen Kane." But come on, there's nothing wrong with having at least SOME iota of intelligence in a movie of this genre. A total waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely fantastic. Just having the Nemesis is this movie is worth 5 stars. He looks incredible. I liked the first movie alot, but I love the second one. Anyone who has not seen this has to check it out.

Although it didn't seem as dark and scary as the first, it made up for it in action. The movie picks up where the first one left off. As our heroine has escaped the hospital she finds a devastated world. She must find her only surviving friend and do what she can to bring the Umbrella Corporation down. She finds out more horrible truths about them and is assisted by a unlikely allie. Both movies complement each other nicely. I definitely recommend you add this to your Horror/SciFi collection. A must for anyone that owns "Resident Evil". I am looking forward to the third movie in this set.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil.  I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse.  With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film.  With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie.  With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>First of all, I need to get my biases out of the way.  I have followed and played almost every Resident Evil game (both good and bad) from the very first one on the Playstation through the latest and by far the greatest on the Gamecube.  When I heard they were making a Resident Evil movie, I was uncertain of how I felt; were they going to remake a game into a movie or would they create a movie that fit into the Resident Evil mythos?  The first movie did the latter, introducing new characters while fitting pretty nicely into the mythology of the RE videogames.  It wasn't a great movie by far, but it was at least quasi-faithful to the series.<br /><br />Now we have Resident Evil Apocalypse which falls into the former category as it takes familiar characters and incorporates basically parts of Resident Evil 2 and 3 into movie form.  Unfortunately, it falls flat for me.  On one hand, I was thrilled to finally see the Nemesis on the big screen.  Being the unstoppable killing machine that he is and spouting that famous gravelly line, "STARS!" I was immediately excited to see the movie but I was worried how they would incorporate Alice from the movie with Jill from the video game.<br /><br />To be faithful to the video games, you can't.  It's that simple.  By having this movie, it's as if Resident Evil 3 never took place.  It takes the premise of the movie: people trapped in Raccoon City with zombies and the Nemesis, and completely changes the story.  Every time I started to get pulled into the movie, something would happen that would make me go, "wait, that didn't happen in the game."<br /><br />That said, my friends who haven't played any of the Resident Evil games had a fun time.  I think those who haven't played the video game will have a better chance of enjoying it.  Although, video game aside, I think the action is pretty stale and there's not a build up of tension like in the first movie.  I enjoyed RE 1 much more than this sequel and so did my friends (both RE junkies and not).  However, this movie and this series is much much much better than the majority of video game adaptations.  With movies like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, even this movie stands as a king above them which is kind of sad.<br /><br />At any rate, not as good as the first, not very faithful to the video game series and not very thrilling.  But, it can be enjoyable for a rent or to see the Nemesis in a movie.  Hopefully the third movie RE Afterlife will take place before Resident Evil 4 (the game) and won't deal *directly* with any of the games.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>This movie got straight to the action before any plot even started which made the movie even better.Most people judge this movie by saying it's stupid and not having any point,but people who love to have fun with action films,this is for you.It's fun,<br /><br />scary,and gets you going,and it doesn't have stupid love stories in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>I like Milla Jovovich as a superhero.  Her breakout role in "The Fifth Element" was all that was needed to sell me on her.  She was fine in the first "Resident Evil", which was better than perhaps it was given credit for.  But in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", Jovovich's Alice is given something of a makeover.  When we last saw Alice at the end of the first movie she had been captured by scientists from the evil Umbrella Corporation and was subject to some tests and experiments.  At the end of the movie we saw Alice walking alone on a street that was desolate and ruined, as if there were some sort of war or battle.  It is at this point that "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" begins.<br /><br />Raccoon City is the victim of the T-Virus from the Umbrella Corporation.  This virus turns ordinary people into flesh eating zombies (is there another kind?), and like any good zombie virus, it is highly contagious.  Umbrella Corporation apparently has the power to lock down the city and prevent anyone from leaving, but there are still some citizens left alive, including "disgraced" police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory).  Jill, and another officer attempt to hide before leaving the city and while being confronted by some nasty zombie creatures they meet Alice.  During that whole period where she was a captive and the victim of experiments, Alice has apparently picked up some sort of upgrade to her natural biology because she kicks serious butt here.  She fights like a super soldier or super hero, more like "The Fifth Element's" Leeloo than anyone else.<br /><br />Besides the hordes of zombies, there is also a new super zombie looking creature called Nemesis which is stalking the city.  Exactly what Nemesis is and where it came from is a little bit of a mystery, though a little thinking about the clues given will solve the riddle fairly quickly.<br /><br />This is a nothing special action/zombie movie.  Fans of the first "Resident Evil" may be disappointed.  I know that despite myself, I did enjoy the first movie.  There was more character interaction and character development, but this movie just had hordes of zombies and a bit too much action.  And while I like Jovivich as a superhero, this didn't seem to be a role that really needed to such an incredibly strong superhero.  I guess I didn't belive it.  The door was left open for a third movie, and perhaps there will be one, but until that point there is no real reason to watch "Resident Evil: Apocalypse".  There are far better movies out there.<br /><br />Grade: C<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is very similar to the George Romero Dawn of the Dead Movies with similar zombies trying to eat the living.  This was caused by an experiment gown awry.  The group of people in this one are in a cordoned off city looking for the daughter of the scientist who caused the mess.<br /><br />The female action hero is excellent (reminicent of Gena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight) and the action is well choreographed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing.<br /><br />Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless.<br /><br />The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities.</p></br></body></html>
