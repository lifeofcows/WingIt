Tim Burton movies are an a acquired taste while entertaining then do sometimes seem a little out there though that's what makes these movies so entertaining in the first place. The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.  I do advise new comers to try and watch a trailer or clip though as while many especially fans greatly appreciate the movie it might not be for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>Beetlejuice one of Tim Burton's best movies he has done during the 1990's.  I enjoy this movie loads and watch it time and time again.  I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.  But if you love a good comedy movie and talented actors and a very talented director then pick this movie up and enjoy laugh after laugh time and time again.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of "Beetlejuice" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, "Beetlejuice" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>After the Maitlands (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) are prematurely killed in an automobile accident, they are returned to their home as ghosts. Meanwhile, the old country house is sold to trendy New Yorkers that entertain unwelcome changes to its charm.<br /><br />The Maitlands want them out, but have difficulty scaring the New Yorkers. So, their 'afterlife' case worker suggests hiring a bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton), to do the job.<br /><br />The New Yorker's daughter (played by Winona Ryder) serves as mediator and plays a strong supporting role.<br /><br />These words best describe the direction of Tim Burton:<br />"Know what they say about people that commit suicide? In the after life, they become civil servants."<br /><br />This flick is entertaining and worth the price.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>There's not much I can say that others haven't said. This is a really fun film, with good writing and a cool story, along with some fun characters and creative ideas about the afterlife. I usually don't give five stars, but this movie certainly deserved it, so two thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>ITS BEETLEJUICE!!!!

This movie makes me laugh every time I see it. This movie has amusing twist on a standard ghost story. This is Tim Burton's hilarious, skeptically humorous comedy about the afterlife of two honeymooners.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's unique vision, which is almost cartoonish at times, really comes across, in this film. A dark comedy, that accents the humor, rather than the horror. Also noteworthy is, Michael Keaton's character, which is not only annoying to the living, but the dead as well. Winona Ryder's character is also interesting to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.  It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br /><br />Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character "Beetlejuice"- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a "haunted house" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" was director Tim Burton's first film but "Beetlejuice" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>awesome<br /><br />I've been watching Beatlejuice for as long as i can remember. ive seen it so many times its now easy for me to quote lines. this is a great humorous movie that will forever and always be even better the more times i watch it. definately a classic.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is ghoulishly funny in this wonderful blend of horror and humor. Enjoyable family viewing on a Halloween night. Invite the neighborhood goblins over.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Here's the plot of 1988's "Beetlejuice", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>I loved it. Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed. It wasn't the best reviewed movie when it came out but that's because critics most likely didn't know what to think about it.<p>  It has fun effects, a wacky and energetic performance by Michael Keaton and an original plot. After all these years there's still nothing quite like Beetle Juice. I mean what other movie has giant sand worms that eat dead people ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Tim Burton is a guy Hollywood should honor every day.

This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.  The movie is about a couple who dies and a new family moves into the house and the couple doesn't want them there because the mother wants to redecorate the house.  this movie has an all-star cast Geena Davis, Alec baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey jones, and many others.  This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.

Grade:A-.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>My one-star refers to this so-called "20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition" of this hilarious and eye-popping delight from director Tim Burton.<br /><br />Since the inception of the DVD format, I have been waiting for a proper DVD of Beetlejuice with commentary and special features.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that this pathetic disc is NOT what I have been waiting for.<br /><br />Though they supposedly have spruced up the picture, the ONLY special features are three Beetlejuice cartoons and I think some music track or something.<br /><br />NO commentary, NO behind-the-scenes, NO nothing.<br /><br />So -- NO sale.<br /><br />I'm still waiting...</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop.

The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />If you don't have the old, not-so-great DVD, the new release might be worth waiting for.

This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I recently saw the DVD 5.1 version of this film and it is excellent. The picture quality is, excuse the pun, picture perfect. The sound is very good on the surround but not much on dialog separation if any at all. But Alec Baldwin makes up for the rest. I have always told my partner that Alec would be the only guy in the world that i would leave him for.  I know it would never happen but each time i watch this movie my fantasy runs wild just like the movie itself.  This is just pure fun, pure entertainment, no thinking involved, no serious plot, no hardship, non racist, non potical just pure fun.  Get  it,,,,,you won't be disappointed.  If anything get it for Alec,,,,they don't get any hotter than him.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>Simply put: Beetlejuice is the funniest comedy of its kind since Ghostbusters.<br />  Michael Keaton plays the title character, a fun-loving ghost that likes to do mischief.  Beetlejuice is called by a couple (Davis and Baldwin) to get rid of the people who live in thier house.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn't we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled "Guidebook for the Recently Deceased." They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but "went out on his own." He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It's a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I like this movie. Specially the part when the family and their guest are sitting down at the dinner table and the ghost, Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), make Della (Catherine O'Hara), start sing a song. Then Adam and Barbara make everyone join in with a dance. Very funny stuff. I also like Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton. I think they picked the right person to play Beetlejuice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>In beetlejuice I was entirely sucked into this dream like film. The afterlife was a complete quirk, and if it hadn't been accredited to, I would have known already who had directed it. It felt like Batman in it's tone, in its wet darkness, and then the cubistic art world of the urban. I always feel like I'm drawn into the mind of a deeply rooted "pure abstract" painters mind. I love the demensions of his creativity. He takes risks also, something I don't see enough of in his latest works. I always feel like it's halloween after watching this film. In fact it's a sort of tradition to watch this film, along with "a nightmare before christmas", around halloween time. Nothing gets me into the mode better. An ecclectic scare, with a foolishness appropriate enough to remind you of the cartoon.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>a couple dies.they live in a house as spirits and then some people move in.the dad is a dork.the mom is a control freak,crazy women who sculpts.she is a similar character in home alone but in that one shes a unbelivably terrible and neglectful psycho mom.the daughter is a dark depressed girl played by wyona ryder.she looks very sexy in thisone.a cool line is:my whole life is a dark room.one big dark room.they get constant visits from other weirdos also.the 2 dead people-some dork and a belive it or not somewhat sexy geena davis play them.they spirits try to scare the living out but are too good natured to suceed.so they hire michael keaton-beetlejuice-to get rid of them.he is more forceful.it is a tim burton movie which of course means its awesome.most everyone could like this.wyona ryder looks awesome in a red wedding dress late in the film.that stupid child hater of a mom lady is this movies only flaw.shes such a bitch.this movie is full of well written mastery and great special effects.it is great!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>You either Like Tim Burton or you don't,I fall in the latter.BeetleJuice is not a big deal for me despite it's huge following and Burton's Following,While there are funny moments I am not the type to like Alice In Wonderland type films that are "trippy".I think the Highlight for Me Is Robert Goulet(Goulet!robert gouleeeeeeeeet!)and Wionna Ryder,I can't stand Baldwin.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, "Attention K-Mart shoppers!" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Michael Keaton brings no distinguishing characteristics to the ghoul 'Beetlejuice', he merely acts bizarre, as does the script.

Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />This new release is being marketed as the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.  It will be newly remastered, but the extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), a music-only track, and the trailer.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but usually that doesn't happen.  I've subtracted one star for the poor features in a "deluxe" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.  The best thing is likely to be the remastering, which is needed, since the older DVD wasn't all the great.  Looking forward to that.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>This is definitely a guilty pleasure.  As often as I think I'm not supposed to be liking this film, I can't help it.  The cast is what does makes this a solid and rewatchable vehicle.  It also has the steady feel of a Burton film, with great production values and a great sense of its own ability to frighten and delight all at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>I should have only given it four stars because for a 20th anniversary edition I expected more, what I got was a cleaned up version of the theatrical release.

Five-star movie, three-star extras.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the complete specs for the sound haven't been announced.  There will be sound and subtitles in several languages, including Spanish.  The old standard DVD isn't all that great in terms of video quality, so the best thing about this new release is likely to be improved image and sound.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Oh, snap, that's right, Alec Baldwin once upon a time was svelte, as so documented in BEETLEJUICE, the 1988 film that - along with CLEAN AND SOBER - made a case for Michael Keaton having a streak dark and dangerous enough to qualify him for the then upcoming Batman role.<br /><br />It can be tough when you're newly shuffled off that mortal coil, tough when the shelf life exceeds the expiration date. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance "bio-exorcist" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn't much help. Adam and Barbara's irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it's a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn't know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte's catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder's appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only "house guest" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let's face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it's her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse's getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton's awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton's bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There's a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film's offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story. Exorcism has never been more fun... or backwards.<br /><br />So this DVD is The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition and offers these paltry bonus features:<br /><br />- 3 BEETLEJUICE Cartoon Episodes: "A-Ha!", "Skeletons in the Closet," & "Spooky Boo-tique"<br />- the option to watch the film in Music-Only Track<br />- Theatrical Trailers for BEETLEJUICE and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Keaton was amazing in BEETLEJUICE, one of Tim Burton's funniest movies. Alec Baldwin, and Geena Davis do a credible job in their roles as newly departed homeowners caught up in underworld bureaucracy, and Wynona Ryder is delightful as the morbidly-inclined daughter of the 'bio' invaders of the home Baldwin, and Davis don't want to move on from. There are very few dark farces as comically twisted as this delightful romp through the afterlife, and none with a more hilarious lead anywhere. I haven't grown tired of watching this macabre laugh-riot in twenty years, and unless you're missing a funny bone, you won't either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>After 20 years, this oddball dark comedy hasn't lost its irreverent impact. Up-and-coming director Tim Burton's playfully twisted visual style runs rampant through this movie, saturating nearly every frame. It even turns actor Michael Keaton into sort of a vile living cartoon, the one & only Beetlejuice, a manic bio-exorcist with sinister agendas. The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker's death-obsessed daughter, Lydia). But this is really Keaton's movie all the way, in spite of a good cast.<br />The art direction, make-up & special effects have Burton's distinctive stamp all over them.<br />I was slightly disappointed that this 20th Anniversary Edition didn't have at least interviews or a making-of featurette (although it includes a handful of the delightful "Beetlejuice" animated episodes).<br />However, it's a little offbeat comedy that's achieved cult status over the years (all you have to do is view it to figure out why). Just don't say the title three times!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their "paranormal hosts" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,"say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!"Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as a very convincing couple with great chemistry), are dead.
