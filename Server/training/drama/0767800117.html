Recently in preparing materials for this space to be posted in honor of Black History Month I noticed that I had not reviewed the subject of this entry, the Oscar-winning film "Glory". I make amends here.<br /><br />This fictionalized version of the creation of an all black volunteer regiment (at least in the ranks) hews pretty closely to the actual events in that process, taking into account the inevitable dramatizations required by the "laws" of cinematic license. And that fact is important. In other commentary on the history of the 54th, and in previous recollections of my own personal history of "discovery" of the regiment I have noted that in my high school years in the 1960s no mention was ever made of the exploits of this hardy band of soldiers fighting for their freedom and the preservation of the American union. None. And that, my friends, was here in Massachusetts the home of the regiment and of the famous, if then obscure, Saint-Gaudens memorial plague to the regiment that in front of the State House that, at one point in my life I passed every day.<br /><br />Lincoln and other Northern war leaders hesitated to create all black regiments for a number of reasons despite the need for man power on the battlefield as the war drew out inconclusively for a long period. Those reasons did not include the fact that the likes of the revolutionary black abolitionist Frederick were clamoring for black soldiers not only to preserve the union but to actively gain their own freedom, to prove their manhood and worth in the parlance of the time. This film details the struggle by hard abolitionist Massachusetts Governor Andrews and a significant portion of the white Boston citizenry, including the eventual leader of the regiment, Robert Gould Shaw and his parents, to create such a unit.<br /><br />The film goes on to look at the actual creation of the unit , its training, the troubles over pay, the racial animosities on both sides of the class line that were then current in that American time, the deployment of the regiment South and the mauling that it took at Fort Wagner, including the deaths of Shaw and many brave black soldiers. I will tell you the best part though, although this is not brought up in the film. At war's end what was left of the Massachusetts 54th marched through Charleston, South Carolina, in many ways the ideological and political center of the Confederacy, singing "John Brown's Body". That seems just about right. Hat's off to the 54th.<br /><br />Note: I have not mentioned the very good performances here by Denzel Washington as a testy recruit and Morgan Freeman as the wise old man of the regiment. Let me put it this way, if you had a choice, wouldn't you have this pair in this type of film. No-brainer, right? Matthew Broderick also shines in an understated performance as Colonel Shaw.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>This film never fails to move me. It is quite simply one of the best of its kind. The period details are perfect, creating a heart-breaking realism. The cast couldn't be better. The leads , of course, have all gone on to remarkable careers. Danzel Washington stands out, giving one of his most moving and powerful performances. It continues to be a painful, sad, yet uplifting film. Why this is so has to do with the remarkable film-making of the director. Much of the film is silent. There is very little dialog really, lots of battle scenes, lots of slow-motion, beautiful music. Simplicity is the key. Each character grows in this film, there are no stereotypes. We care deeply about each and every one of them. The final shot of the dead Captain is very painful to see. It is a picture about the horror of war, but not about the horror of this war, however horrible it may have been. For every good man, there is a bad. For every act of decency, there is a substantial crime. It takes a small amount of courage just to watch the film. The culture wars sometimes make one wonder what has become of our so-called institutions of learning, but this little picture proves that we are heading in the right direction by telling stories once ignored.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Freed Slaves fighting for their own freedom... seems like an odd concept but it's true. Freed from one bond of servitude, these men of color were chained to another bond of servitude, the U.S. Army. Battling for freedom and equality that was nothing if not weak and half-imaginary, these brave men fought valiantly to earn a previously-unsung spot in history.<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman lead a magnificent ensemble cast in a movie that is about more than just a war. It's about an epic struggle. A struggle between men, between races, between thoughts, between ideas, between societies and between past and future.<br /><br />The bravery of the men depicted in this movie should never again be forgotten. The unselfish sacrifice and the reward they were denied for so long should stand as a lesson for all time. They were given nothing though they were expected to give their all in the service of a country that hated them, that thought they were no more valuable than a horse, a mule or the dog sitting on the front porch.<br /><br />The courage and the humility is must have taken... it gives me shivers just thinking about it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I agree with another reviewer this film should definitely be viewed in schools.  Broderick gives a great performance as well as the ever talented Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Andre Braugher.  I, too, love the 54th and the memory of what these men accomplished should never be forgotten.  Great direction, script and score.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>Great film on the American Civil War. Well acted (especially Matthew Broderick and Morgan Freeman), great story etc. Recomended</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>What a disappointment that there weren't more oscars for this film.  I don't know what what more I can say about this film.  It's already been said.  Morgan Freeman should receive awards just for breathing.  He's phenominal.  Just think, all that talent going to waste on that kids show, the electric company, many years ago.  His best scene is probably when he comes across Shaw for the second time.  The first time they meet is just after a battle where Shaw is wounded and laying on the ground, unconcious.  Freeman's character kicks Shaw to see if he's still alive (he was the grave digger).  The second time they lay eyes on each other, Shaw is reviewing the troops and Freeman's character is standing in the ranks.  Shaw is riding by on horseback.  The two men lock eyes and their heads slightly nod as they ackowledge each other.  Freeman's nod to Broderick is the coolest thing in the movie at least to me.  It lets us know that he is not easily scared or panicked.  It serves him well later on in the film.<br /><br />As for Matthew Broderick (Colonel Shaw), I believe that this is the best film he's ever done.  He gave a wonderful performance as the leader of an all black unit.  Broderick does a fine job of letting us see Shaw trying to find a way to communicate with his men and trying to figure out how to train men that will probably never get to fight like the white units do.  I believe due to the subject matter, all parties tried to give it the proper respect and honor to the real soldiers of the 54th.<br /><br />Frankly, I think all the performances were on target.  Even the costuming department went through great pains to get the uniforms exactly as they were back then.<br /><br />Denzel Wahington's finest scene is probably the whipping scene.  His character, private Tripp, leave the camp to find shoes so that he can fight.  Instead he finds himself charged as a deserter and is sentenced to be whipped in front of his unit.  His shirt is remove and reveals that he has already beat beaten many times with the scars from the whip to prove it.  In defiance, his stifles any screams that might escape from his throat while being beaten and instead, lets one tear roll down his cheek.  The timing of that one tear just as the music swells to the crescendo is pure genius.  Also noteworthy as this film unfolds are the relationships that develop between these three men.<br /><br />Unforunately, everyone in the 54th unit dies (in the movie anyway) and it always makes me sad that my favorite characters don't survive.  Shaw and Tripp who were at such odds in the beginnig of the movie are buried together in a mass grave at the end of the movie.  I had never heard the story of the 54th nor had I known that there was an all black unit anywhere.  I'm glad the movie brought the story to light.<br /><br />This movie is a must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>Usually movies based on historically facts are plagued with inaccuracies. Fortunately this is not the case!<br /><br />It is a great reconstruction of the Civil War period based on personal letters from Col. Shaw and two books: Kirstein's "Lay this Laurel" and Burchard's "One Gallant Rush". From this solid documental background an outstanding film emerges.<br /><br />The storyline follows the evolution of the first all Afro American Regiment in the USA Army.<br /><br />Show step by step from the recruiting, boots camp practice, first war actions till the mighty final charge.<br /><br />Col. Shaw and his aide Maj. Forbes should fight prejudice within the officers and high command.<br /><br />Sgt. Major Rawlings should fight to bring together his green bunch of recruits into a soldier's team, proud of themselves and capable to endure and overcome all obstacles.<br /><br />Pvt. Trip should fight to tame his rebel soul in order to be part of the group.<br /><br />The movie has many great moments; three of them are delivered in the last fifteen minutes: the soldier's meeting the night before the attack, the regiment passing thru the deployed army and the glorious final charge. Really unforgettable!<br /><br />Matthew Broderick has the perfect physque-du-rol? to impersonate a very young man (almost wet behind the ears) charged with an overwhelming task. He delivers a nice acting piece.<br /><br />This said, undoubtedly, the best acting performance are in charge of Denzel Washington, justly awarded with Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />Edward Zwick as director (he is also a very successful producer) delivers his best film up to this day. Better IMHO to "The Last Samurai" (2003) that was a very good one.<br /><br />I hope he will give the public a good version of one of my favorite fiction book: "The Lions of Al-Rassan" (promised for next year).<br /><br />This is for me the best Civil War movie I've seen. Enjoy!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>GLORY is a grreat movie based on the 54th Regimen in the Civil War, (one of the first all black Regimen).  Based on the diary of Col. Robert Shaw, this is a great movie for all and a great helper for the classroom (trust me, thanks to this movie I aced my American History final with ease).  <p>Matthew Broderick is young Col. Robert Shaw and he has been apointed to lead one of the first all black regimens following news of the Emancipation Proclamation made by President Abraham Lincoln.  From there, it follows all of his diary entries and his letters to home, showing the pride of soldiers and the strength to win a war.  Plus with the strong supporting cast of Carey Elwes, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, GLORY is a strong, dramatic and in some parts touching movie.<p>I have to admit I was a skeptic when I heard that Matthew Broderick was going to be a lead in this movie because when I think Matthew Broderick, I think FERRIS BUELER.  Broderick really showed that he is a true actor in this movie and he did a very good job.  Denzel really showed why he won his Best Supporting Actor with his role and this movie and as usual, Morgan Freeman did very well.  <p>Now of course, this is the Civil War era and the N word is thrown around a lot.  In most cases, it's used out of context in a racist and/or derogatory way.  You have to get past that because as unfortunate as it is, that was a part of history.  A very unfortunate part of history but still it's there.  Again, this is a movie about war and this movie does push the horrors of war in your face.  Nowhere near as bad as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but the depiction of war in this movie is very strong as well.  This is a great movie and a great recommendation to any and all history buffs or to anyone that's interested in the African American approach to the Civil War.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>GLORY...is very deserving of all it's praise. It is a fine film full of action and emotion. It also shows that people in the Union treated African Americans the same as  people did in the South. But this isn't why it's a great film. The film's recreation of the time period and the epic reenactments of the battles of Antietam, James Island and Fort Wagner were incredible, and the performances turned in by Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington (in his much deserved Oscar-winning performance), and Morgan Freeman were superb. The DVD also deserves much praise, with documentaries that show the plight of the colored soldier as well as some fine behind-the-scenes material. A film Civil War buffs will cherish forever! Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>let me begin by say this was the most emotional film i have ever seen,i neerly found my eyes turning bloodshot red in the climatic ending&quot;i sad almost red&quot;not only emotional but this film is true based on the first black regiment in the civil war.the wardrobes are authentic lookinking the battles are very realistic and the characters ah! the characters so wonerfuly acted.the film diminstrates how willful the human soul can be,and how man can endure brutality for what he truly belives in as the case for the black regiment in this film.you must see it to belive it and here it to feel it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Glory is the 1989 masterpiece starring Matthew Broderick as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw in this true story of the 1st black Union battalion to go into battle.  Morgan Freeman portrays the wise Sergeant Major Rawlins and Denzel Washington the cynical Private Trip who comes to believe in the Union cause.  Also Andre Braugher is great as Thomas the free well-educated black Bostonian.<br />  Heavy hitting emotional impact as Blacks fight against the Fascist South, but find Union racism rampant.  And the sense of becoming part of history, especially the final battle.  Robert Gould Shaw's ideals for the country were as noble as fellow Bostonian, JFK, and in effect they shared the same fate, the fate that noble ideals often lead to.<br />  Finally the theme music is perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>As President Lincoln credited the men of colour with helping to turn the tide of war so do I credit the makers of this truly exceptional civil war film in helping to turn the tide of filmmaking. Performances are all top notch. Sound and music are pulse-pounding in dolby surround. Battle scenes are recreated with an intensity rivaled only by films such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. This is the definitive Civil War film.<p>  If you are aware of the real story behind the 54th Regiment who made the assault on Fort Wagner, then this will bring that story to life. Denzel Washington won a well-deserved Academy Award for his work, and I am surprised that the special effects crew did not win one as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Columbia Tristar 1/98 release of the DVD edition of "Glory"....<br /><br />There are many glowing reviews of "Glory" to be found here. I feel the same way about this wonderful film, and after touching on the story I would like to talk about this DVD release(see above) which is an outstanding quality and excellent value.<br /><br />"Glory" is an exceptional film. A true story of the Civil War that is both touching and inspirational. It depicts the story of the first  black unit from the North to be trained  and actually go into battle. Led by their very empathetic but very young Colonel(played brillantly by Matthew Broderick), the 54th Regiment endures many hardships felt not only by being soldiers of this devastating war but as African Americans as well.Their spirit, pride and tears along the way, is projected in this film by these wonderful actors in a way that will make you feel all the anguish and pride that they felt.<br /><br />The cast includes Morgan Freeman as the Sergeant who is the motivating force behind the soldiers. His performance is stirring. Denzel Washington, awarded Best Supporting Actor by Oscar for his role as the runaway slave looking for a home will move you to tears(or at least put a lump in your throat, which remains throughout), and Andre Braugher's smile and tenacity will grab you and keep you.The cinematography and sound(both also honored by Oscar) are exquisite.Beautifully directed by Edward Zwick it is a war story that is more than action, it is one you won't soon forget.<br /><br />Often, the different DVD editions wind up on the same product page. You may have found yourself on the page of the "Special Edition" of Glory. That is the 2 disc edition with lots of special features. If these are important to you in a DVD than that is the one you should probably go with. However, if you really love this film, but don't want to spend as much for all the extras, this edition is identified by ASIN:0800177967. It is half the price of the "Special Edition",and is a beautiful transfer as well.You have the choice of viewing it in the original widescreen(1.85:1) or a full screen version. The picture is beautiful, sharp, crisp and clean. Colors spectacular. Depending on your set up the sound options are 5.1(Digital Dolby) or 2-channel surround.I watched it in the 5.1 and was very impressed. All the sounds of the Civil War were clear and distinct. The music wonderful. It may be viewed in Spanish or French and has subtitles in English, Spanish and French also.<br /><br />Whatever edition you choose, this a a film that is a beautiful addition to your DVD collection.It is one that will be watched again and again.  Thank you and enjoy.....Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>That line, uttered by an obscure character, a white Union soldier watching the Massachusetts 54th Infantry prepare to assault a heavily-fortified Confederate fort, signifies the acceptance of the Union Army's first all-black regiment.  GLORY, director Edward Zwick's Civil War masterpiece, shows us the evolution of the 54th, from a ragtag group of former slaves and freemen--a group under supplied, underpaid, and initially used for manual labor and looting--to an efficient fighting machine.<p>Like many other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew Broderick's portrayal as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the young, idealistic leader of the 54th.  Broderick gives this character depth, compassion, credibility, and yes, maturity.  And what else can be said about the supporting cast, including Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Cary Elwes, other than &quot;exceptional?&quot;<p>GLORY is profound entertainment:  gripping, violent, raw, and emotional as the fragile subject of race--of racism--is brought to the forefront.  It is a story that is as timeless as it is transcendent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>In 1989, "GLORY" would become an important movie that introduced many Americans unfamiliar to Civil War history but most of all, to show viewers the impact African Americans had in the role of fighting for the Union.<br /><br />The film would focus on Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the letters he sent to his family and him leading a group of African American men who volunteered to fight against the Confederate Army.  This group is known as the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.  The film is also adapted from Lincoln Kirstein's book "Lay this Laurel" and Peter Burchard's book "One Gallant Rush".<br /><br />"GLORY" was directed by Edward Zwick ("DEFIANCE", "Blood Diamond", "The Last Samurai" and "The Siege"), screenplay by Kevin Jarre ("The Mummy"and "Rambo: First Blood Part II"), music by James Horner "Enemy at the Gates", "A Beautiful Mind" and "Troy") and cinematography by Freddie Francis ("Dune", "Clara's Heart" and "Cape Fear").<br /><br />The film would star major talents Matthew Broderick ("WarGames", "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", "Godzilla" and "Inspector Gadget"), Denzel Washington ("American Gangster", "Training Day", "Man on Fire" and "Remember the Titans"), Morgan Freeman ("The Dark Knight", "Wanted", "Million Dollar Baby" and "Deep Impact"), Cary Elwes ("The Princess Bride", "Twister", "Liar Liar" and "Days of Thunder") and Andre Braugher ("Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer", "Poseidon", "Frequency" and "Primal Fear").<br /><br />The film would receive five Academy Award nominations and win three for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Denzel Washington", "Best Cinematography - Freddie Francis" and "Best Sound Mixing".<br /><br />"GLORY" is powerful!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"GLORY" is presented on 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:85:1).  The film manages to capture the haziness of war due to the smoke in the battlefield and the colors are not featured as vibrant as most of the settings are in blues and browns but you will see reds on the flag and the flares, amber colors from the gunfire and the greens of the grass and tress, but I believe that the limit of color was the Director Edward Zwick's purpose.  Zwick is director that has made several films to capture the dreariness of war as he did nearly a decade later with "ENEMY AT THE GATES", he manages to capture the look of the battlefield in 1989 with "GLORY".<br /><br />The film does have quite a bit of grain that comes clear due to its High Definition transfer but I would rather have grain than overly used digital noise reduction that would make the characters look waxy and the picture quality as soft.  In fact, one thing you will notice with "GLORY" is you see quite a bit of detail of the actors, their surroundings but also objects such as shovels, rifles, clothing, etc.  But overall, the picture quality is solid.<br /><br />As for the audio, the film is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (also in French, Portuguese in Dolby True HD 5.1 and Spanish 5.1) and the lossless soundtrack manages to capture the many explosions on the battlefield.  But what captures your attention when it comes to sound is James Horner's musical score.  The music sets the tone of the film especially during the final battle.  Dialogue is clear and very clean and many of the scenes during the battles where artillery, gun fire and people yelling (even those yelling from a far distance) can be heard.  There were scenes that do utilize the rear channels effectively and I believe there were some scenes where explosions took advantage of some low frequency booms on the subwoofer.  Overall, "GLORY" receives its best audio presentation compared to its original DVD counterpart.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"GLORY" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Edward Zwick - Edward Zwick is known for his war films from "GLORY", "Enemy at the Gates" and "The Last Samurai" and one thing that I enjoy about his commentaries is that he really gets into the technical goals and explain the difficult scenes.  "GLORY" features just that as he really goes into detail of the filming techniques used on the film.  Such as trying to drown out the blue skies with smoke, working with the talent, the staff, James Horner for the music and tidbits such as not having enough money to hire more stuntmen, so the stuntmen trained the extras on several scenes.  Also, how challenging it was for Morgan Freeman to have to run countless times especially uphill to having horses that were trained to fall.  A very informative commentary.<br />  * Virtual Battlefield - Civil War Guide Map - This was actually pretty good.  By using your remote, you can learn about certain battles from the Civil War with photography and text information.  But some have video commentary by Civil War historians which was quite informative.<br />  * The Voices of Glory - (11:16) This features letters from the Civil War written by actual soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and giving a voice to the men who fought in the various battles including the battle at Fort Wagner. Featured in Standard Definition.<br />  * Documentary: The True Story of Glory Continues Narrated by Morgan Freeman - (45:18) A documentary featuring the factual information of the soldiers that fought during the war and were members of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry with additional detail on Col. Robert Gould Shaw.  Also, the coverage on the Civil War re-enactments that are ongoing today and an actual re-burial of soldiers.  A documentary that is very informative and you learn about other names that were instrumental during the battle against the Confederate Army at Fort Wagner.  Featured in Standard Definition.<br />  * Original Theatrical Making-of Featurette - (7:35) Featured in Standard Definition, this is the original featurette with interviews with the talent and Director Edward Zwick.  The featurette has a few behind-the-scenes footage from the film.<br />  * Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary - There is commentary by Director Edward Zwick on two scenes.  For The Applepicker (3:03), a scene which revolves around Pvt. Trip making his first kill.  The second and final deleted scene is one that Zwick calls one of his worst and glad it was cut from the film.  The scene is titled "Crisis of Conscience" (2:35) which is a scene involving both Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes).<br /><br />For those who owned the two-disc special edition DVD release of "GLORY", you may not want to ditch your DVD just yet as the "Picture-in-Picture Video Commentary featuring Ed Zwick, Morgan Freeman & Matthew Broderick" is not included on this Blu-ray disc.  Nor are the scene selections on the Blu-ray sporting any motion.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"GLORY" is a powerful war film that shows an epic depiction of the battles that have taken place at that time.  Powerful performances from Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher, I was in awe of how epicly enormous this film was from start to finish.<br /><br />I really enjoyed "GLORY" for its storyline but also being educated about a part of Civil War that many people are probably not familiar with.<br /><br />In fact, Director Edward Zwick talked about in the commentary of going to Harvard University and living in Boston and never knowing the significance of the Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment on the Boston Common.  And how he felt that this film not only was a positive for the people who worked on the film, great for his career but mostly for how significant the film is used by teachers using "Glory" as a tool to teach about the Civil War.<br /><br />The film definitely made me interested in learning more about the war but also key figures which include Colonel Shaw and American abolitionist Frederick Douglass.  But the film also opened my eyes at the time of how soldier placement truly was.  This is very interesting because these people stood probably less than a hundred yards from each other before they shot at each other.  Where forts had the use of cannonballs and artillery for long distance destruction, foot soldiers were just really close to each other and had to constantly reload their rifles.  And watching the final battle and in a way, oncoming military groups were like sitting ducks.  The military tactics of the time made me realize why the Civil War had the most number of deaths compared to Americans killed in World War I, II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.<br /><br />Of course, the film and the actual history have some differences and its important to note that the only major character from the film's regiment that truly existed was Col. Robert Gould Shaw but the challenges that the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry faced during that time was quite real.  The combat role that African-Americans played in Civil War very much real.  The factual events, especially details that have come out right after the film was released is documented on "The True Story Continues" documentary which is included on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Again, for those who own the 2-disc DVD Special Edition released back in 2007 and wonder if its worth the double dip.  For picture and audio quality, my answer is yes but I highly recommend not to get rid of the DVD as the "Picture-in-Picture Video Commentary featuring Ed Zwick, Morgan Freeman & Matthew Broderick" is not included on this Blu-ray release.  Personally, I think people would have loved to hear insight from both Freeman and Broderick about working on this film.  So, I'm a bit surprised it was not included on this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />But nevertheless, "GLORY" is still a solid Blu-ray release.  The HD transfer definitely gives the viewer more detail and makes the battlefield come alive.  It's a powerful film and definitely worth owning and having in your Blu-ray collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>"Glory" is a modern film classic that highlights a little-known chapter of the Civil War that I'm happy to own. This film brings the issues of the time - slavery, freedom and sacrifice - down to human scale. We can understand why the men of the 54th were willing to take up arms, and how tragic it was that they had to sacrifice their lives in order to be considered men.<br /><br />Broderick, Freeman, and Washington, along with a stellar cast play it faultlessly. Broderick actually does bear a resemblance to Shaw, and shouldn't be criticized for his boyish looks. I felt every nuance of the burden he carried, and thought Broderick did a wonderful job.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's powerful acting may never again have a showcase like it did in "Glory." His beauty, rage, and pride scream in every frame. His Oscar for this break-out role was highly deserved. Trip's character is really the distillation of what this film is all about: the black man's heart-rending battle for worth, recognition, and dignity. As far as I'm concerned no one BUT Washington could have played Trip. Thank God for Denzel!<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is the film's human core. His quiet compassion and leadership keeps the soldiers focused. His one angry confrontation with Trip proves he has the goods to back up a field promotion to Sergeant Major.<br /><br />Freeman (an appropriate reminder of where surnames come from) is the father figure the regiment desperately needs in a time of death and crisis. The men look to him for his calming wisdom and reasonable, fair demeanor.<br /><br />Films like "Saving Private Ryan" raised the technical bar for battle scenes.<br /><br />The fighting scenes in "Glory" are, unfortunately, it's weakest element. The staging and choreography are mediocre at best. And other than a scene where the 54th Massachusetts is given a hero's flanking onto the battlefield beaches of South Carolina, these shots don't emotionally engage the viewer. Still, in the end, "Glory" isn't about big, noisy battles. It's about the transcendence of the human spirit in the face of bigotry, bad treatment, and almost certain death. It's about a watershed moment in our bloody history that elevated us all and must never be forgotten.<br /><br />"Glory" is, indeed, glorious.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This is the kind of film that is very rare: an historically important creation where everything works.  The writing is excellent, the acting is superb, the cinematography is outstanding, the scope is epic with a phenomenal score that courses through the movie lending it amazing depth of emotion.  This film is flawless and filled to the brim with interesting characters and historical significance.  There are many fine acting performances here, the lead actors shining on several occasions.  Matthew Broderick has the performance in his career that finally shed that "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" stigma and established him as an A-list actor capable of carrying a dramatic role as well as sustaining comedy.  Denzel Washington is mesmerizing to watch, owning each and every scene he is in and completely earning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Cary Elwes, fresh from his enthusiastic performance in the 1987 classic "The Princess Bride," also shows some dramatic chops as surprising as Matthew Broderick brings to the table.  Then there is Morgan Freeman, who is the pride and center of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, and his performance sparkles accordingly.  There are so many great performances in this film that I could write for pages describing them all.  Of course, there are the incredible battle scenes, as well.  They are brilliantly staged, from long-range battle tactics to hand-to-hand combat with muskets fixed with bayonettes.  The intensity is realistic and exciting and oftentimes chilling.  At the time I saw this film in the theater back in 1989 I considered it the best Civil War film ever made.  In my mind, it has yet to be surpassed.  "Glory" is exceptional filmmaking on every level and should find a home in every DVD collection.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>the whole movie is about the first black regiment i believe it is.  this is a great movie you will see how long it took them to go to battle with permission.  most to every one died.  this movie has so much character to it.  it is a shame what they went threw.  if you like true story's watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>This is a Civil War film, the story of the first and only black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Cavalry, to actively participate in the bloody business of war. A young white officer from a wealthy Boston family (Matthew Broderick) takes on the grueling job of getting these men ready for battle. He is tough, untried, but idealistically driven to turn these men into soldiers and he does.<br /><br />This is the heart of the story, watching the unit grow from roughshod to ready, forming bonds of friendship that reveal their own inner problems. The common desire to engage the enemy, thereby breaking down a unique military prejudice, is another absorbing part of the story.<br /><br />The cast and characters grab your heart and keep it until the final second.

Shaw and his drill sergeant prepare the recruits for war unaware that their superiors have no intention of using these troops in combat.<br /><br />The frustrated manual laborer-soldiers were eventually given the chance to engage a Confederate patrol and acquitted themselves well. They next spearheaded an assault on South Carolina's Fort Wagner. Shaw and over 100 of his men were killed in this action and more than 150 were wounded and/or captured.<br /><br />This film's strength is the depiction by a sterling cast of friendships between the men, their struggles with a bigoted military, and the at times uneasy interactions with an empathetic white commander. The battle scenes, culled from two sources (including a 1988 Gettysburg reenactment) are secondary to the human story.<br /><br />(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000051YMQ">DVD version</a> of GLORY is here)<br />Also recommended: the 4-hour epic, GETTYSBURG-- one of the greatest war movies ever made.

And the quote given by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, "If I should fall, remember what you see here," speaks volumes for the courage and bravery of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment as well as for all Negro soldiers who have ever served in the military to fight for this country.<br /><br />Aptly titled, "Glory" references the impact that these men had upon history.  It doesn't matter that they were unsuccessful in taking Fort Wagner.  What matters is that in that assault, they earned the respect of many of the white soldiers and men who witnessed their courageous attempt.  Why is this so pivotal?  Because during that time period, even their white allies viewed the Negro soldier as being useless in a fight.  Remember that most people felt that they were largely inferior.  The assault on Fort Wagner proved them wrong, and at least, this began a change in views about the value of Negro soldiers, in not only the Civil War, but in subsequent wars that followed.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick leads and all-star cast as Robert Gould Shaw in this epic film about a young, white abolitionist from Boston who is offered command of the 54th Massachusetts regiment...one of the first all-Negro regiments to serve in the Civil War for the Union.  Shaw initially shows his inexperience as a commanding officer.  He makes mistakes, but he is quickly able to win the hearts of the men he commands.  His ideal is in the right place, as he tries to not only train them, but to understand them.  Even many of his officers don't believe that the 54th will ever see combat.  Shaw feels that it is his duty to prepare them, and prepare them properly, as evidenced in a wonderful scene in which he chews out his best friend and XO, Major Forbes, for not teaching the men how to use a rifle properly.<br /><br />Denzel Washington, who earned a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar, plays a runaway slave, Trip, who embodies the heart and soul of the regiment.  He's an angry man, and one can hardly blame him once we see the wounds on his back from repeated beatings.  He's full of anger and hatred, and he desperately wants to fight, even though a large part of him thinks that it will all be for nothing (how ironic considering that African-Americans would not be given their true rights and freedom by the government for nearly 100 years).  Denzel is perfect in the role, especially during the whipping scene in which a continued, painful stare is held until a single tear falls from his face.  It's one of the best scenes in the entire film.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is equally riveting as another runaway slave, John Rawlins, who has been living in the North for a number of years, working as a grave-digger, and wondering when, if ever, he would be given the opportunity to fight.  Rawlins's prime role is not only in helping Shaw relate to the men, but also in looking out for the men as well.<br /><br />At first, Shaw finds himself having to push against the system to get even the most basic needs for his men, such as shoes and socks (considering most of his men are either barefoot, or have shoes that barely function).  When he finds that his men are only being used for slave labor, as well as for helping to illegaly pillage southern towns, he finally uses his powerful government connections to put pressure on the general to allow his men to fight.<br /><br />This film has so many powerful and touching moments, I could fill up pages relaying them all to you.  One of my favorites, is the men singing the night before the assault on Fort Wagner.  They are singing around a campfire and asking the Lord for his blessings.<br /><br /> Another, is Shaw on the beach, realizing that he probably won't be coming back from what seems to be an almost suicidal mission.  However, Shaw realizes, that regardless of the outcome of the battle, a great victory is on the verge of being won even though he is fighting through his own fear of an almost certain death. And this is why he says those epic words to the reporter as he hands over his journals, "If I should fall, remember what you see here."<br /><br />I must mention that powerful music that accompanies this film by James Horner.  Using the Harlem Boys Choir, he gives the film and almost haunting sound, as if these men are calling to us from the past; to demonstrate that they didn't die in vain, but paved the way for every African American soldier who would ever help to fight for the freedoms of this country.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>&quot;Glory&quot; the name says it all.

Both gave stunning and moving performances.  The visuals that made you feel like you were there were astounding as well.  Mr. Broderick does a wonderful job of portraying a character who is sometimes self-righteous and self-seeking and at other times inspiring and self-abasing.  Mr. Washington provides the angry man to bring out the more sedate and clear-thinking Morgan Freeman character.  All come together in common bond that builds in fighting together for a common cause.  It is a somewhat one-sided and shallow portrayal of the war's causes that may not go over well with the lovers of history.  But, the coming-of-age band-of-brothers mood of the film is moving and enjoyable all the same.  No matter which side you may favor in that conflict (if either), you will still find yourself cheering with the rest, "Give-em Hell 54th!"</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>Flawless movie making at its best! Patriotic and powerful telling of the true beginning-of-the-end for the Confederacy. Ex-slaves and free blacks alike, finally allowed to defend their dignity, were the final blow to the Southern bondage of an entire race of human beings history tells us. The Truth based story of the Massachusetts 54th. Only the beginning of black heroics during the Civil War.<br /><br />From the dignified talent of Morgan Freeman, to Denzel Washington's Academy Award winning performance as a militant loud mouth runaway, great acting to suit everything else about this film. And another level of respect achieved for Matthew Broderick indeed. So many standout scenes, but most memorable, Denzel's beating. Back already scarred from his cruelly treated past, he takes his punishment in total silence. Only allowing a single tear to fall during a cinematic closeup. Heartbreaking.<br /><br />The highest rating possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Glory is a truly extraordinary motion picture in all sorts of ways.  As a proud Southerner, I have to say no other film has ever had me cheering for a Union regiment taking on a company of Confederate soldiers.  I was a little worried that this film would demonize the South, but it proved to be a most even-handed treatment of all parties.  By demonstrating the racism of Northerners - soldiers and civilians alike - it paints a most nuanced portrait of the African-American men who seized the opportunity to don the blue uniforms and fight for a country many of them must have been unable to truly call their own.  That only makes their heroism and bravery all the more poignant.  The War Between the States can never be understood in simple black and white terms on any level, as many a Union soldier clearly wasn't fighting to emancipate the slaves (just as many a Rebel soldier wasn't fighting for slavery).<br /><br />Even when they actually used to teach actual history in the schools, the story of the 54th Massachusetts regiment was a subject that never really came up - and that is what gives Glory such an extraordinary amount of historical importance.  I wouldn't go so far as to say the heroism and sacrifice of this first African-American regiment in the Union army turned the tide in the War, but it did lead to the acceptance of actual black fighting soldiers in the Union ranks - and 210,000 such recruits certainly proved important for a fighting force that basically won through strength of numbers (as more blues than grays died in the war).<br /><br />The movie itself, though, is really about the men who led and made up the 54th Massachusetts regiment - and there are sterling performances all over the place.  As I have said many times in the past, Morgan Freeman is the best actor living today, and his character, Sgt. Major John Rawlins, is really the heart and soul of the whole film.  As an older, runaway slave, he has gained a measure of wisdom and restraint that Private Trip (Denzel Washington) has never even imagined.  Trip wears the scars on his back proudly, and he is not about to stand down before any man.  Washington earned a Best Supporting Actor award for his role, and rightly so.  Educated freemen are represented by Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), who seems ill-suited to the harsh realities of war but shoulders the burden with pride and determination.  At the head of these men rides Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a young officer who secured the position more by family influence than merit, perhaps, but he more than rises to the challenge to fight both for and with his men.  Despite his lifelong friendship with Thomas, he has almost no connection with the men of the 54th and must learn to know them and earn their respect.  The Union army doesn't even want to supply his men with necessities such as decent shoes and a uniform, nor does it really have any intention of actually sending them into combat.  Thanks to the Colonel, though, the fighting men of the 54th do eventually get their chance to prove themselves by leading what is basically a suicidal charge against Fort Wagner in South Carolina.<br /><br />Aside from the multi-layered story itself, one must be impressed by the realism of the action.  War is an ugly business, and that fact is brought home in the very first scenes showing Colonel Shaw's charge during the Battle of Antietam.  While there should have been small rivers of blood covering the battlefield, watching a soldier's head basically explode makes for a vivid stamp of realism.  While I would question the tactics employed on the assault on Fort Wayne at the end, the movie certainly does capture the nature of the fog of war and the viciousness of hand-to-hand fighting by heroes on both sides.  Of course, this is a movie, so there are numerous historical inaccuracies as to the main characters (none of whom, other than Col. Shaw, are based on the actual soldiers) and battles, yet Glory certainly does succeed in telling the story of the 54th Regiment in the most compelling of ways.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>What an excellent film and what great extras.<p>If you are a high school history teacher, buy this for your class.

Why are we made to see the African American troops through his eyes instead of seeing him through theirs?  <p>Despite that petty rant, and some historical inaccuracies (e.g., the 54th was not the first regiment to hire non-whites), this is a very well-made movie that's definitely worth owning for its absolutely electric atmosphere.

There's a lot of other issues that go on with the Civil War and the general is having trouble having to direct african-american soldiers into war, especially a good friend of his named Thomas.<br /><br /> While based on a true story, this was a decent civil war movie for it's time. Matthew Broaderick is pretty well cast as the general. Morgan Freeman is also in it and his role was cool as a grave digger who also directed the soldiers. "Glory" has an emotional ending, which goes without saying in concluding that it is a masterpiece.<br /><br /> 4 and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a very fine and very powerful film.  I liked it when it first came out, and now watching it with my children all these years later, I like it even more.  It is a rare film that not only holds up over time, but I found it a more powerful experience than I had remembered.  Why does it hold up so well?<br /><br />It isn't just the story that this regiment plays in the Civil War, or the story of Shaw leading and fashioning these brave men into soldiers, although that is a terrific story.  There are also the very powerful moments in the film that stay in the memory.  Matthew Broderick shows the qualities and the youth of Robert Gould Shaw.  He is a young man of high ideals despite his family's wealth and position.  He also has the ability to show courage despite his very real fears.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is quite powerful as the powerful Private Trip.  He is a man who has been so tortured and so abused that his anger has twisted him.  Yet, he still has a strength and nobility that shines through in several unforgettable scenes.  Morgan Freeman provides his magisterial presence as John Rawlins, who is tender enough to care for the mute drummer boy and tough enough to provide credible leadership as the eventual Sergeant Major to these new soldiers.<br /><br />Andre Braugher is fantastic as Shaw's friend, the very literate freeman Thomas.  His enthusiasm for the cause is boundless and his transition to becoming a soldier is quite hard for him.  He has so far to go from his comparatively privileged private life to the hard life of an infantryman.  He makes the role live brightly.  Jihmi Kennedy brings a lot to the role of the illiterate, but kindhearted Jupiter and I wish we saw more of him  on the screen whether big or little.<br /><br />All of them make that gospel meeting the night before battle a powerful scene in the movie.<br /><br />And don't forget the wonderful Cary Elwes who plays Shaws more worldly friend Cabot Forbes.  While he is Shaw's subordinate, he also has a fierce independence.  In some ways he is stronger than Shaw and in other he is less.  However, I don't believe Forbes could have accomplished the job in getting these men formed and into battle simply because his worldliness would not have let him believe it was possible.  It was Shaw's idealism (in the movie) that made it happen.<br /><br />Terrific.  And I recommend it strongly.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Sony / Region Free<br />Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS<br />Running time: 2:02:14<br />Movie size: 34,635,988,992 bytes<br />Disc size: 43,462,595,610 bytes<br />Total bit rate: 37.78 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 25.74 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  1668 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 1668 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  French  1550 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 1550 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps)<br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  Portuguese  1612 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 1612 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English (SDH), English, French, Portuguese, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 16<br /><br /># Audio commentary<br /># Virtual Civil War battlefield - Interactive map<br /># The voices of Glory (SD - 11m:18s)<br /># The True Story Continues (SD - 45m:18s)<br /># Original theatrical making of - (SD - 7m:36s)<br /># 2 Deleted scenes<br /># BD-Live enabled</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>This movie, which was nominated for three Oscars and won all three, should  have swept the Oscars in 1989. Unfortunately, it was hampered by two sets  of negative criticism: one which held the film should have been entirely  about the African-American soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts, and not at  all about their white officers; and one which said Matthew Broderick lacked  the authority to be a believable military commander. Both schools of  thought are ridiculous beyond words. What Glory celebrates is our common  humanity, particularly the bond between soldiers fighting together for the  sake of freedom; this is, in fact, the entire point of the film, and it  would be impossible to depict if either whites or blacks were  supernumeraries. As for Matthew Broderick's performance, for me his  boyishness adds to its power. His character is a pampered young man from a  privileged background who must, in a time of national emergency, become a  leader of men, and Broderick is the perfect actor to play such a character.  For me, this film goes almost beyond praise.  The performances--not only  Broderick's but also Denzel Washington's, Morgan Freeman's and Andre  Braugher's--rank among the greatest of that decade; the battle scenes are  played for maximum suspense and emotional impact; the cinematography of  Freddie Francis is blazingly brilliant.

Director Edward Zwick wants to praise the black soldiers` stenght and relevant contribution, yet unfortunately his perspective is too similar to that of an average, altough well-intended, TV-movie. Sure, there are plenty of good performances here (Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, most of the cast is fine, to be fair) and the settings are competent enough, but the movie drags in many moments, has too many patchy scenes and the annoying and awe-inspiring score doesn`t help. &quot;Glory&quot; is a relevant document, not quite a particularly strong and impressive cinematic experience.

It is still a great and moving story now, even after 45-odd viewings.<br /><br />Base on the true story of the Union's raising of the 54th Mass. Infantry, "Glory" takes the viewer into the life and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. As the commanding officer of the 54th, he has to deal with many obstacles, including indifference amoung the army at large, out-right racism and supply problems sponsored by that racism. Even his own Major, (played by Cary Elwes), fails at first to see any real combat value significance to the 54th.<br /><br />"Glory" has a cast of people who made the movie truly shine. Denzel WAshington is deservedly well-praised for his role as a bitter, hate-filled runaway who finds belonging in the ranks of the 54th. Thomas, Colonel Shaw's childhood friend, develops from one who tries to keep his old ties alive, to a soldier who knows his place in the army. Morgan Freeman shines also as the Regiment Sergeant Major, the glue that holds the men together and keeps them out of trouble many a time.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick was a surprise casting choice, and perhaps was not the best for the role, in my opinion. He comes across as a bit soft and pliable for a man who had to overcome such opposition and institutionalised bigotry. Perhaps the real Colonel Shaw was deceptively soft?<br /><br />Everything else about this movie was near perfect, from the acting, locations and music to the action and depth of the tale being told. For enthusiasts of the U.S. Civil War, this movie is hard to beat, and stands firmly in the tradition of great Civil War tales. Definitely, it is a must-see for anyone interested in the period.

But what I say, is the film based on the letters of Robert Gould Shaw who commanded the 54th Massachusetts.  Much of the film deals with the black soldiers but it is told from its commander's perspective.<br /><br />This is a great film about the civil war and the first black outfit.  The film was directed by Edward Zwick, a great director from television (Family, thirtysomething).  He does a great job of blending the drama and action.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick was best known for his roles in teenage films and found a film that would usher him into adult roles.  The soldiers were gathered from the up and coming ranks.  While most had success in a film, they were not considered bankable stars. These actors include Denzel Washington (Oscar winner Best Supporting Actor), Morgan Freeman (who should have won for this film but was nominated for Best Actor for his other film that year Driving Miss Daisy), Andre Braugher (from Homicide: Life on the Streets).<br /><br />This is a must see film for everyone.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>About the first black regiment (the 54th Massachusetts) to fight for the Union in the Civil War. The movie traces its history from its creation in 1862, through its training and treatment as almost a joke by the government, and its near-annihilation in South Carolina while attacking Ft. Wagner at Charleston. Col. Robert Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick) was the commanding officer, a white man, and the usual conflicts regarding honor and duty and fairness occur under the circumstances. The soldiers are whipped into shape almost despite themselves and earn their glory under fire. Denzel Washington is excellent as a tough-as-nails one-time slave.

And the Federal command had determined that it must be taken at all costs.  But it would be a veritable suicide mission for the regiment that served as the vanguard of the assault; therefore, volunteers were called upon, rather than being chosen arbitrarily by the General in command.  At this point, a young Colonel from Boston, Robert Gould Shaw, stepped forward to offer his regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first unit comprised of black soldiers in the history of the U.S. Army, for the job.  "Glory," directed by Edward Zwick, is their story.<p> Soon after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army was opened up to blacks; and the first to respond were those who ultimately made up the 54th.  Shaw, an abolitionist, was approached about taking command, and he accepted, putting his beliefs on the line and determining to make real soldiers of these men.  And he did.  In the beginning, however, he had no idea of the formidable task awaiting them in the not too distant future, when they would face an enemy bastion that was heavily fortified, well manned and which maintained a decidedly advantageous position geographically.  But leading up to that, Shaw had his men trained properly and stood by them as they formed the bonds amongst themselves that ultimately saw them through the battles they had to fight, on the field and off.  It was rough going; but under Shaw's command, they were able to secure something they had never had in their lives-- dignity as human beings.<p> Going into this project, director Zwick was adamant about adhering to historical accuracy in all areas of the story, from the events themselves, to the smallest, seemingly insignificant details they would put on the screen.  And he succeeded.  When the soldiers of the 54th, for example, are informed that their pay would be ten dollars a month, minus three dollars for clothing expenses-- seven real dollars pay-- instead of the thirteen they had been promised (which was the pay the white soldiers received), Shaw and his officers, in a show of solidarity, tear up their own pay envelopes and refuse to accept their wages until their men get their full pay.  The battles, as well, from Antietam to Fort Wagner, are authentically represented.  The assault on Fort Wagner, especially, seems like an almost romantic notion of gallantry, but the fact that if happened just as depicted here makes it all the more involving.  Zwick painstakingly recreated every aspect of the battle, and sets it up geographically and in such a way that the viewer is able to anticipate, without getting lost as the action unfolds.  The outcome of the battle is, of course, a matter of historic record, and especially for those well versed in the history of the Civil War, this film should be an entirely satisfying experience.<p> Matthew Broderick gives an engaging, understated performance as Shaw that  captures the essence of the man, whom we get to know initially through his own words, from the letters he wrote home during his time in the Army (which are now kept in the Houghton Library at Harvard University).  The film begins, in fact, with one of Shaw's letters being read over the action.  Throughout the film, Zwick uses this method to move the story along, as well as to give some real insight into Shaw, and through his thoughts, the men of the 54th and the events in which they are engaged.  And Broderick seems to embody the man you picture as being the author of the words being read.  He portrays Shaw, not as a cinematic, John Wayne type superhero, but heroic in a very real sense; as he leads his men against Fort Wagner, you see a man obviously afraid, but determined to uphold his principles and ideals, for which he is willing to die.  It's not a flashy role, but Broderick, by creating a character to whom virtually everyone will be able to relate and sympathize, is clearly the strength and the star of the film.  <p> There are a number of outstanding performances in supporting roles, also, particularly Denzel Washington, who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Trip, the embittered former slave who is at war, not only with the Confederates, but with life.  Trip is a complex character, and Washington gets to his soul, awakening the bitterness as well as the somewhat caustic humor with which he wages his daily battles.  From the first scene in which he appears, Washington dominates the screen, even in the scenes in which Trip is not the center of attention.  It's a powerful performance, without question deserving of the Award.  Morgan Freeman gives a memorable performance, as well, as Sergeant Major John Rawlins, the elder statesmen of the 54th, who in his way sets an example for the younger soldiers, and eventually even Trip.  Also worthy of mention are Andre Braugher, as Thomas, and Jihmi Kennedy as Jupiter Sharts.<p> The supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Major Forbes), John Finn (Mulcahy), Donovan Leitch (Morse), Bob Gunton (Harker), Cliff De Young (Montgomery) and Jay O. Sanders (General Strong).  Beginning with an accurate and insightful screenplay (by Kevin Jarre), Zwick uses all the tools at his disposal, including great cinematography (by Freddie Francis, who received the Oscar) and some memorable performances, to deliver an unforgettable and historically significant film.  Zwick is to be commended for the honesty of this film, and for maintaining the integrity of the story, which he never embellished simply for dramatic effect, which simply wasn't necessary; the drama that the 54th Massachusetts played out in real life was enough.  And that is what Zwick presents, in "Glory."</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Historical war drama about the Civil War battle at Antietam, and the formation of the first black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry. Glory is a masterful piece of work that will leave you breathless. Matthew Broddrick plays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and performs him masterfully. Denzel Washington's performance was powerful as well. This movie stands as a great achievement, that could very well be called a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>and mostly true, this look at the doomed black soldiers accepted into the Union Army during the waning days of the Civil War shouldn't be missed. Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his best performance, and the supporting cast is stupendous.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>Generally, I am not a huge fan of action films, but I make an exception with GLORY, quite possibly one of the best historical dramas ever filmed.  Colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a 25 year old volunteer soldier in the Federal Army during the American Civil War, helped lead the 54th Regiment, made up of (predominantly) former Black slaves.  Shaw encountered and had to fight off great opposition and racism toward his regiment, along with Private Trip (Academy Award winner Denzel Washington) and Sargaent Major John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman).<br /><br />This film is moving, the performances are fantastic and the story is beautifully and artistically presented by director Edward Zwick.  I really think that this should be a mandatory Black History Month film and is definitely an important part of U.S. history worth knowing more about.  Fantastic......</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Edward Zwick's vivid Civil War epic boasts terrific battle sequences, but aside from the story's inherent fascination, what sets this movie apart are the incredible performances glimpsed in between the gunfire. Broderick brings to Shaw a nuanced mix of determination and vulnerability, but Denzel Washington virtually steals the picture as a defiant enlisted man.( He won an Oscar for this.) Morgan Freeman also shines as a wise, seasoned regimental sergeant. Both great entertainment and history lesson.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This is a powerful and inspirational film dealing with a truly great Civil War story.  The 54th Mass. Volunteers was the first uniformed black regiment to fight in the Civil War.  The story here is wonderfully told, and the film pulls no punches about the prejudice and adversity that the soldiers of the 54th had to endure in order to get what white soldiers took for granted--acceptance by the rest of the Army as the fighting men that they were.<br /><br />The 54th was officered by white soldiers, and here Matthew Broderick puts in a fine performance as the Colonel of the regiment.  His eventual bonding with the men, and the mutual respect that gradually develops as the regiment congeals into a well-trained fighting force, is wonderfully done and quite inspirational.  Morgan Freeman does his customary stellar job as the regimental Sergeant Major, to whom the Colonel comes to look for insights about leadership and the problems of the men.  Denzel Washington (disclosure: this is one of my favorite actors) plays a signficant role as Private Trip, who enlists out of pride and the desire to prove he is the equal of anyone.  Trip refuses to accept the lesser pay afforded to black soldiers. White soldiers were paid $13/month, black soldiers $10.  It is a historical fact that many black soldiers refused to accept the $10, or any pay at all, until Congress eventually corrected this outrage.  The rest of the cast was quite good as well.<br /><br />The battle scenes in this film are incredibly good--in my opinion this sets the standard for how a battle should be done in a film.  The action never takes precedence over the plot, but I was quite literally absorbed by the intensity and the drama of both the first skirmish in which the regiment is blooded, and the later major assault in which the regiment is given the (nearly suicidal) lead position.<br /><br />This is a big budget film, and deserves every one of its five stars.  It features an inspiring story, excellent acting, lots of action, and realistic sets and battles.  What more can one ask?  This is one to which the discerning viewer will return many times.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Not many Americans ever acknowledged the existence of Black soldiers in the Civil war, or World War 2 for that matter.  Glory is the true story of how the Black Americans in the 54th Regimen fought for a country that didn't appreciate them.  Not enough can be said about this movie.  The story is solid, the performances by the actors is excellent.  Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and several other black actors give fantastic performances as black men, but all of them very different black men.  An escaped slave, a grave digger, and an educated free black man (from the time when blacks were free in Boston).  Broderick gives one of his most unique performances to date, setting aside the image of Ferris Bueller to play a young Colonel who trains and prepares the men for combat.  His performance is accurate, playing a young but smart and wise Commanding officer who genuinely believes his men are equal soldiers to any other regimen.  The movie is powerful, beautiful, frightening and thought provoking.  The men who died in this story died for real, and for almost nothing.  Their story should be told to everyone, so they can realize that more then just the heroes who wrote history existed.  Highly recommended, especially the Special Edition DVD.  There are a lot of extras and interviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>Recently, I rented the DVD of the Civil War epic Glory. I had seen the movie before and I loved it. This DVD only made me appreciate more and I'm glad I rented it.  <p>Matthew Broderick gives an excellent portrayal of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who is selected to lead the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first all black regiment of the Civil War. He not only has to fight for respect for his men, but also for his own respect. Cary Elwes is Shaw's brother, who is picked to help lead the 54th. Among the soldiers is Denzel Washington, in an Academy Award Winning Performance and Morgan Freeman. Washington, in the beginning of the movie, has no respect for the White man and hates him. But at the end, he gets rid of his hatred. That's what I think the film's final image represents: the unity of the black and white man as one. Shaw also gains the respect of his men when they charge Fort Wagner.  <p>The extras on the DVD are excellent. There is a commentary track from Director Edward Zwick that is excellent, though it may distract you from the movie. There are two featurettes: The original 1989 featurette that briefly covers the film's making and "Voices of Glory", which covers the story of the 54th from the actual letters from those who served. There is the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for two other Denzel Washington movies (A Soldier's Story and Devil in a Blue Dress). There are also talent files and two deleted scenes. Though fascinating, after watching these scenes (With or without Zwick's commentary), it will be easy to see why they were deleted in the first place.  <p>The picture and sound quality is excellent. My only gripe is that in some scenes the sound is a bit low. Glory is one of those movies that uses both images and sound to its advantage. Nevertheless, the film is still just as powerful, especially during the final scenes at Fort Wagner. <p>So all things considered, this DVD transfer is excellent and would make a welcome addition to anyone's collection</p></br></body></html>
