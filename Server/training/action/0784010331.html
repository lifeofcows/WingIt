I must have seen this 30 times over years - a strong, well-paced script rips the audience through the basic setup quickly before sending us on exactly the ride that Quaid paid for at Recall.<br /><br />In a story that has really nothing to do with Philip K Dick's original, it does manage to pack in enough science fiction elements without collapsing under the weight of its own ludicrousness. The script leans heavily towards suggesting it was all a dream so almost anything far-fetched can be explained from this angle.<br /><br />In traditional Paul Verhoeven style, it offers a level of violence that makes most horror films look like children's TV, and in the DVD extras he gleefully  justifies it quite convincingly. The in-camera special effects are what really gives this film its unique look - the clever animatronics, well designed models and sets all combine to create a mutant-filled Mars that looks great on camera. Although I'm sure 2012's remake will all be CGI, it will lose some of its charm as a result.<br /><br />Total Recall also had a near-perfect cast. Sharon Stone shines as his double-agent wife, Rachael Ticotin is a great love interest, and Michael Ironside bellows his way through as the psychotic Richter. Even Ronny Cox is perfect playing pretty much the same character from Verhoeven's Robocop. It's a really a classic in so many respects.<br /><br />As an aside, it's interesting which technologies in this film have become a reality, from the 3D body scanners to the location tracking on a handheld device. Although I don't expect colonies on Mars anytime soon, Johnny Cab might well be the commercial incarnation of Google's self-driving car!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Although the film is 15 years old ... the subject matter is so contemporary it has all the ingredients to be a classic. First, it is about a colony of inhabitants on Mars, a planet which has been inhabited for at least 1/2 million years. Next, there is suspense, action and drama associated with a cover-up by an earth-based government agency which is tied to the secret identity of Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwartzenegger). On the surface he is an ordinairy construction worker on earth ... yet his dreams and possible flash-backs of events and activities on Mars hint at something more deep and covert. Eventually he explores a fantasy vacation trip to Mars in a mind-altering program called Rekall ... to develop insight into his dreams. From this point forward the film explodes in a myriad of action-packed and creative directions ... all of which help unravel the implanted identity of Doug Quaid/Hauser. The film gains momentum and is nonstop action. It depicts Arnold Schwartzenegger as the super-charged hero who nearly single-handedly brings about justice ... on a distant planet. The casting in this film is superb: his earthly wife, Lori is played by Sharon Stone and his lover and partner on Mars, Melina, is played by Rachel Ticton. There is a cast of "Star-Trek"-like aliens that work in harmony with the earth colony to fight oppression. In the end Quaid discovers the suppressed technology which saves the climate of Mars for future generations. It is one outstanding film.

It's an awesome sci-fi action tail with enough twists and turns that leave you wanting more.<p>Total Recall is tells the story of Douq Quaid(Schwarzenegger). He's a man that dreams about going to mars. He's a normal guy who has a construction job. He's married to his wife Lori(Stone) and they are new to the place they are living. It's set any where from a 100 to 150 years from now. Space travel is a common thing, and like I said Quaid wants to go to mars. Everyone he knows is steering him away from the whole idea of going. He sees a commercial on tv from a company called Recall. Recall puts an implant into your memory that acts as a vaction. It makes you feel like you've gone on a vacation because it's in your memorys. Quaid goes to Recall and thats where the movie really picks up.<p>While he's at Recall they find out his memorys have already been erased. The company puts it off as they did nothing to him but are unsuccesful. Quaid then finds himself being hunted by different people who want him dead. He doesn't why and he must follow the clues that are left for him to find out why.<p>That's kind of the cliff notes version of the movie. Like I said it's a complex storyline that changes a lot. You have to see it to fully understand it.<p>Arnold is outstanding. This is probaly the best acting he ever did in any of his movies. His action scenes are great in the movie. You see him kill plenty of guys plenty of different ways. His character Quaid is probaly the most complex character he's every played, because Quaid isn't sure who he really is. It's really great and Arnold does a great job.<p>The special effects are great. They did win the Oscar for best effects in 1990 and it's easy to see why. The different mutants they create on mars are great. When people are stuck in the vaccum of mars they really do look like there going to explode. The different explosions and blasts just look great, and it's another reason to watch the film.<p>I love Total Recall. It's a movie masterpiece. If your an Arnold fan it's definetly a must see. Most sci fi fans should get a kick out of it as well. Even people that like a good mystery or a fast paced movie should enjoy it a lot. This Special Edition comes in a cool Tin case that's kind of like a KIWI shoe poish case that makes a good collectors item. Don't miss out on this movie. You'll regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>This one was a waste of money.  It's no better than the DVD.  I promise you.  This realization is both good news and bad news for me.  The bad news is that I expected it to look alot better than it does as a Blu-Ray disc.  The good news is that I really don't think that I will have to replace many of my regular DVD's that I already feel look very good as they are.  So, I'm going to be spending alot less money on replacing my DVD's than I had at first thought.<br /><br />You know, my previous Samsung Progressive scan DVD player with the HDMI hook-up option, really made my old DVD's look better than my first DVD player.  So, if your DVD player has the HDMI hook-up, you're going to find that replacing your DVD's with Blu-Ray may not impress you with any serious visual improvements.  Although, I have discovered that some Blu-Ray releases have shown a greater re-mastering effort, but only because the DVD version wasn't mastered very well in the first place.  But, I've got some great looking DVD's.  I don't think it will be necessary to replace them with Blu-Ray unless they sell for maybe $10 or less.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but it was certainly not one of the first Blu-Ray discs that I ran out to buy.  I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I may only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.<br /><br />I've got a Blu-Ray player now, and I doubt I'll ever buy another regular DVD again, but, I won't go crazy replacing my regular DVD's just because a Blu-Ray version is available.  If I were younger, I might.  But, I feel that I'm older and getting wiser with every Blu-Ray disc that I watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>"Total Recall", at its core, is a straight-up action vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger.  At least, that is what it was supposed to be.  However, it actually succeeds so much more as a psychological thriller thanks to director Paul Verhoeven and an incredible script.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Total Recall" follows the very strange set of circumstances surrounding one Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), who one day is living the married life with Lori (Sharon Stone), and the next moment is caught up in an intrigue plot involving a stunning vixen named Melina (Rachel Ticotin) who tells Quaid he is not exactly what (or who) he thinks he is.  But is the whole thing a virtual-reality experience?<br /><br />This movie succeeds because it manages to successfully indulge in two different genres:<br /><br />-First of all, it is an action/adventure flick on par with Arnie's other works.  It is non-stop from the opening scene, rushing forward with special effects (well, special for the time period...!), chase scenes, and tons of gunfire.<br /><br />-Secondly, though, it is also a psychological mind-bender of the highest order.  You really won't know exactly what is going on until the final scene (and even then the result will amaze you).<br /><br />Overall, then, I was very impressed with this flick that I didn't have very high expectations for.  I expected a simple "action romp", but instead was treated to so much more.  It can be watched for many reasons: the action, the thinking, the acting (actually pretty good), or the nostalgia.  Either way, there will more than likely be something for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Total Recall" is an enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick that delivers a lot of excitement and follows a fairly good plot. We wanted to see this before going to the remake (2012) so bought it through Amazon "Instant Video".<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: the story is set in 2084 and follows Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker that dreams of visiting Mars. The future has some interesting technology, including the ability plant memories directly into a person's brain and the "Rekall" company specializes in implanting vacation and adventure experiences for those that can't afford the money or time to take real ones. Quaid decides that this is the only answer to deal with his rising mars obsession and things don't go quite as planned from there.<br /><br />The acting was decent for this type of movie and also stared Sharon Stone as Quaid's wife and Rachel Ticotin as the love interest. The special effects range from just plain bad to very good and the science is often just plain wrong or highly questionable in places, but this is an action movie and it all works for the most part.<br /><br />This was a fun movie that is very watchable.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is one of Arnold's best.

In this future corporations make their own rules and are indifferent to the suffering of anybody that stands in their way. One can see both films as devastating satires of Reagan-era America.<br /><br />As with "Robocop" Verhoeven indulges in gratuitous violence and grim humour that leaves one with a slightly bad taste in the mouth. Still "Total Recall" moves at lightening pace and the special effects are pretty good. There are also lots of nice humorous details included by Verhoeven and a superb score from Jerry Goldsmith.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is one of Arnold's best.

His friend tells him don't, but he goes anyway, and when it gowes wrong, the recall people put him in a cab, thus starting the story.<br /><br />Quaid is confused why people are trying to pop caps in him, left and right; even his pal at work turned out to be another killer in his way.  It's all confusing, you can't help but wonder, why are all of these pople trying to kill him?!  Excessive gore(I'm talking pretty gory here[This movie was almost rated X])  without reason.  But if you keep on watching, you'll find a serious reson to why people want him dead(I'm taliking domination/savior reason)<br /><br />The blood in this movie is someting most action movies don't have anymore(The're all weak compered to this).  If you were offended by kill bill, well this is worse because it's realisticly gory.  Not to mention what happened to people when they were exposed to Mars' atmospere(If you have a full-stomach and are weak then for the love of God refrain from watching those sceenes!)<br /><br />The story behind this is a powerhouse.  About 2/3 through the film you find the reason behind the killing.(Plot twists hit you left, right, up, down, verticly, horizontaly, dianaly, eh, you get the picture.  It's rare to see story in bigtime action flicks like this, ex. Kill Bill, Bad Boys 2, Raw Deal, don't have plots for anything.<br /><br />This movie is a gory work of art, with plot and Violence to keep suspence and action fans happy.  If you're a Schwarzenegger fan, this must be in you collection.  If you love the Terminator series(with the exception of 3) Then this is another great Sci-Fi film to get your hands on.  If you hate excessive gore, you might wanna stay clear!  This movie also left me with a cliffhanger thought: Is it reality, is it a dream, or is what the doctor that went in Quaid's room really saying was ture?  A Cliffganger to a sequal never to come.<br /><br />Peace</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>What a good movie!  This is everything a Schwarzenegger movie is supposed to be.  It is fun.  It is exciting.  It actually is though provoking.  It has a plot, and a good one at that.  The Austrian Oak plays Doulas Quaid, a man not quite happy here on earth.  And while he can't afford a vacation there, he has heard things about a business called &quot;recall.&quot;  This is where the movie gets interesting.  Recall can program memories into your head.  While Quaid is getting his dream vacation, something goes terribly wrong.  He ends up going to Mars anyway, and there are now questions about his identity, what his actual mission is, and about his life in general.  What is made up?  What is real?  Will he ever know?  It makes for a very exciting movie.<p>This DVD looks awesome.  The case is cutting edge, using a Mars cutout on top (the size of a DVD).  The special features look great, too, including commentary by Arnold himself.  This is a must buy.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>Totall Recall on DVD doesn't have a whole lot of extra features, but it does include a full-screen version for those of you who enjoy both aspect ratios. And the while the sound is great, what is really great is the picture. I owned TR on VHS for many years, and the picure quality was very poor, even for videotape. when I picked it up on DVD, I noticed very few artifacts on the screen, and the color representation was near perfect. As for the plot, Schwarzenegger plays Quaid, a construction worker who realizes that his life may not be his. There is A LOT of action in this film, and the explosions will give your subwoofer a good workout. I recommend this DVD to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>If you know a film stars Arnold, you hardly go and see it ( in Cinema or on DVD) for intellectual enlightenment. As for comparing TOTAL RECALL and  BLADE RUNNER... well, talk about Apples and Oranges; I like both, but for different  reasons.<br /><br />I saw the VHS  version eons ago, and remember when the special edition DVD came out in the little "Mars Shaped"  tin container. Almost as weird as the FRIGHT NIGHT VHS case shaped like a Coffin, but quite a nifty idea( However, Video rental Stores Hated it for display reasons).<br />From Years of watching the VHS version, I had a very distinct opinion about the film... I thought it was a straight action flick. Well, the first thing that the commentary  does is to disabuse you of that idea. Verhoeven has very grand ideas about his film-making, and by any standards, this film is at the least, a multi-layered work.<br />Whilst I can appreciate the subtext, and "intertextual" elements of academic books, its not much fun if you just want to escape in a film. Thats why this film works superbly if someone does not actually  TELL you that its not what you think it is ... as in the NAME OF THE ROSE ( both Book and film there are very layered).<br />For my money, if a film cannot entertain you, then its not what I want. Some films serve a different purpose, so if I watch a programme about the Psychoanalytic elements behind the death of Civilisations, I expect to work hard at understanding the work. Or Even a film ABOUT  "Schrodingers Cat" ( that is not about how to train a wayward  feline ) would be something I could halfway expect to be a work requiring some mental effort.<br /><br />The R  rated version of this film is right on the money, and provides great FX, and lots of fun. The M rated version is a waste of time in my view, and also has some very stupid edits, the sort of stuff that appears on the evening news, but has to be cut because of MPAA rules.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the commentary occurs when we find out HOW Verhoeven gets to be the man in the mix.<br />If Arnold can be said to be anything, it would seem that deal broker is definitely part of his resume.<br /><br />If the old adage in the making of movies is that 90% of your effort is put into finding work, then Arnold does this well...  even if some say he cannot act :-).... At the Very least, one can say that he entertains. For my money, I think he can act,  either that, or I just enjoy Arnolds'  antics.</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>Total Recall is one of my favorite films of the (early) 90s.  The storyline is dense and the plotting brisk.  Directory Verhoeven again shows his mastery of "hyper realism" where everything seems overdone yet at the same time convincing.  Jost Vacano's photography is crisp with smooth camera moves.  Schwarzenegger gives what I think is his best "acting" role to this day.  <p>This is one of the few sci-fi jobs from the last 15 years that is consistant throughout.  Spielberg should have watched this before he made the disaterous "Minority Report".  Though also based on a Dick story, Recall doesn't fall flat after an hour, nor does it drowned out with endless exposition scenes that seem to plague Minority Report. Verhoeven also resists explaining it all to us at the end, here is where he shows a dicipline with the material that Spielberg lacks.<p>Bravo Arnold, Bravo Verhoeven.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives on earth and is the average construction worker and his wife is the beautiful Lori Quaid (Sharon Stone).  Douglas visits a company named Rekall who can provide false memories that give you a real life experience. (Like a vacation but having never left home) Douglas selects to go to Mars but even before he is put under he begins to act violently and the Rekall staff puts him under and tries to wipe any memory of his visit to the company.  He already believes he has been to Mars. They send him home in cab and when he arrives there is attacked by his wife and realizes that his memories are coming back and she is some kind of undercover agent....<br /><br />This is a good Sci-Fi film made about life in the year 2084.  Arnold has been living a hidden life and when his real memories begin to come back he knows he has to get to Mars and go to the mining colony.  This is a good movie and depicts some prejudice views of humans toward mutants as second class citizens. Quaid has to stop the cover-up and release the alien artifact that can change Mars forever.  Some of the special effects are not outstanding while others are very realistic.  I enjoyed the movie as entertaining, especially if you like Sci-Fi.  Arnold does a good job in his role and the story line and action sequences move quickly.  I recommend this movie to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoeven's Arnie-boasting sci-fi saga is a whirlwind of violence and pace that investigates the connection between actuality and fantasy, and does so with swagger. Based on a story by Philip K. Dick, this film, which also stars Sharon Stone as Schwarzenegger's wife, was a great financial success (despite its then-huge $65 million budget) and added to the appeal of both of its star actors. As one of the more memorable articles of Contemporary Era science-fiction cinema, Total Recall is a worthy addition to your DVD (or even Blu-ray) collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>There are certain films that aim to entertain and try their very hardest to keep the audience entertained, if not on the edge of their seat, but rarely are they also capable of making the audience think.  This movie is fun from start to finish, but it also manages to keep you thinking about reality and the implications of the ideas presented in the movie.<br /><br />Total Recall is certainly one of the better films to come from director Paul Verhoeven whose career I must say has its ups and down.  He's has RoboCop, which I also thought was a fun action/satire, but then films such as Starship Troopers had me far less impressed.  He is certainly better when adapting short stories in a satirical fashion than he is adapting professionally written stories and trying to satirize them like he did with Starship Troopers- Verhoeven's resulting film seeming more like an insult to its source material instead of an adaptation.<br /><br />Total Recall movie is based on a short story by the late Philip K. Dick, who also wrote the stories behind Blade Runner, Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly.  Unlike Blade Runner and Minority Report this is one of the more satirical approaches on sci-fi and it does have some good laughs among its fun sets and action, but like those two films it provides some of the best science-fiction imagery to date.<br /><br />Of course, being released in 1990, what better male lead in an action film than Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Now, the future California Governor has never been the best actor, but he manages to find one of his stand-out roles in Douglass Quaid, a man who is under constant danger and isn't even capable of knowing whether the dangers he faces are real or not!<br /><br />Tired with his life as a construction worker Douglass Quaid is set on having a vacation to Mars.  Only problem is he's a tad bit low on cash and his wife isn't very keen on taking a trip to the Martian surface- which is currently under a state of civil unrest and urban warfare between the mutants and the evil business leader, Vilos Cohaagon, who quite literally has an airtight grip over the citizens of Mars.  Since going to Mars is out of the question Quaid goes for the next best thing: fake memories.<br /><br />After a visit to Rekall he has it arranged for him to be given a vacation to Mars from the perspective of a secret agent on a crucial mission.  This dream comes a bit too true as he is thrust into a fight for his life, never knowing whether or not what he is seeing is real or not.  The audience can't tell for that matter for there is enough evidence to support either option.<br /><br />Total Recall is good escapist entertainment and is often quite funny in a black sort of way.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is charismatic in the lead and manages to deliver several good one-liners (other than the cheesy "Screw you!").  The art direction, special effects, costumes, make-up, and sets are all quite convincing and fun to look at and overall it is a film that always keeps your attention in some form or another.  I give a strong recommendation to Total Recall, but the film does seem to stay in check and never take to initiative to go above and beyond like Blade Runner and Minority Report have.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>Doug Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) thinks he is just an ordinary construction worker who dreams of moving to Mars. However, after a spur-of-the-moment visit to Recall (a company that implants false memories of holidays into the minds of people who are too busy or too poor to go on them), Quaid suddenly starts to remember a previous life that he lived on Mars as a secret agent. Soon Quaid is being chased by a lot of people who want to kill him and he is no longer sure of who to trust, including his wife (Sharon Stone) and himself.<br /><br />"Total Recall" is a rarity among action films - a film with an intelligent, mind-bending script that is also filled with some incredible set pieces. It can be enjoyed for its story or if you prefer, you can just sit back and enjoy the mindless violence. Either way, it's a really great film. When this film was made, Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career, as was director Paul Verhoeven (who also directed "Robocop") and Stone was about to reach the height of hers (she would reach that two years later when she and Verhoeven again worked together on "Basic Instinct"). Neither Schwarzenegger nor Stone has ever been accused of being a "great" actor, but that doesn't mean that they're not fun to watch, as is the case here. Arnie gets to deliver some great one-liners and kick butt, and as usual, Stone adds a certain trashy quality to the proceedings.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven is fast becoming one of my favourite directors and "Total Recall" has just become my second favourite of his films (after "Starship Troopers"). Verhoeven has a reputation for delivering films with huge amounts of gratuitous, over-the-top violence and he does it again here (although, clearly some of the more violent scenes have been cut down to get a lower rating, since the violence seems kind of tame compared to the "Robocop" director's cut). As I said in my recent review of "Robocop", it is possible that these high levels of violence could upset some viewers. However, to me they seem so unrealistic that I find it difficult to imagine anyone seeing them as being anything other than ridiculous good fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>"Total Recall" is, quite simply, one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action flicks and quite obviously, one of the ones that helped build his super star status at the time of its release.  When this outstanding Sci-Fi action/thriller was released, it was right in the middle of Arnold Schwarzenegger's run of films where he could seemingly do no wrong.  After watching the "Imagining Total Recall" documentary, it's even more surprising to find out that the original director wasn't Paul Verhoeven and the original Douglas Quaid wasn't to be Arny but Patrick Swayze; now that would've been an almost entirely different movie.  Despite the exceptional script, I doubt Patrick Swayze would've garnered the attention that Arnold did for this memorable flick.<p>One of the most interesting aspects behind the script of this film is the overall theme behind it, was it "real" or was it Douglas Quaid's Total Rekall experience?  Another highly interesting aspect of this film is its supposed sequel which may have been scrapped for Arnold Schwarzenegger's bid for and election as the Governor of Kalifornia!  If you pull up the Cast and Crew Information under the Special Features section and click on Arnold's screen, you'll see a listing for Total Recall 2 (2002), something that obviously hasn't happened but who knows what will happen in the future!<p>Credit goes to Arnold for his performance in this film, which was an exceptional display in that his acting skills were only getting better and better; granted, he's not the best actor in the industry, but for his type of movies, he was at the top when this film was released.  Sharon Stone puts on a wonderful performance in this film and this film can most certainly be directly attributed to being the one that led to her super stardom and being cast for some of her bigger roles.  Ronny Cox also does another superior job of being the villain in this movie, a role he has always done well in.  For Star Trek Voyager fans, it's interesting to note that Robert Picardo does the voiceover for the Johnny Cab.<p>"Total Recall" is just another in a long list of outstanding and somewhat gory action flicks for director Paul Verhoeven.  In this genre, he can most certainly be counted among the best directors to ever take up the mantle.  Phillip K. Dick, the author of the short story "We Can Remember it for You Wholesale," the story that "Total Recall" is based upon, also wrote the story that "Blade Runner" was based upon and many more; just showing what a talent this writer has been.<p>The Premise:<p>Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wakes up to find himself lying next to Lori (Sharon Stone), who he believes to have been his loving wife for the last eight years.  Quaid expresses that he wishes to go to Mars but Lori doesn't want anything to do with it.  As Quaid is coming home from work, he sees an advertisement for Total Rekall where he can take a virtual vacation and decides to try it.  Not long after his virtual vacation begins, this action flick takes off on a breathtaking wild ride that doesn't slow down until the credits start rolling...<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all who're interested in seeing one of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever made.  One note of caution though, this film is not for the young, faint of heart or weak of stomach as is the norm with a Paul Verhoeven film.  To achieve the film he's looking for, he doesn't spare the gore at all!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Audio Commentary with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Director Paul Verhoeven<br />-"Imagining Total Recall" Documentary<br />-Rekall's Virtual Vacations<br />-"Visions of Mars" Featurette (This is especially interesting considering we have a rover on Mars right now)<br />-Visual Storyboard Comparisons<br />-Conceptual Art<br />-Photo Gallery<br />-Production Notes<br />-Theatrical Trailers and TV Spots<br />-Cast and Crew Information</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Total Recall is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film; it is also one of the most complex cinematic statements ever made about reality, technology and totalitarianism.<p>The script is cracklingly smart, with multiple setups and payoffs that require repeated viewing to fully comprehend.  And the world of Total Recall is filled with little details that are now becoming closer and closer to reality:  The &quot;nature&quot; wallpaper in Doug Quaid (Schwarzenegger)'s apartment; the &quot;instant fingernail polish&quot;; the &quot;virtual space trip&quot; that forms the core of the film's conceit; and the equation of government and corporation.<p>As Doug Quaid, Schwarzenegger brings his trademark humour and one-liners.  They fit the character well, making his quest for identity all that much more entertaining to watch; Sharon Stone has her breakthrough role as his insidious wife Lori; Rachel Ticotin is suitably heroic as sidekick Melina; and Ronny Cox offers up yet another terrific turn as villain Cohaagen, a much more complex and human character than his character in RoboCop, Dick Jones.  Cox has a way of chewing up megalomaniacal lines yet also bringing moments of realness and vulnerability to his character, and as a result the film acquires a much richer psychological layer.<p>All in all, this film's greatest power lies in its sociological concepts.  &quot;Blue sky on Mars&quot;; &quot;more freedom, more air&quot;; &quot;the walls of reality come crashing down&quot;; &quot;your whole life is just a dream&quot;; &quot;if I'm not me, who the hell am I?&quot;  Each little detail is worth days of pondering over if you're the kind of viewer who likes to analyze text, and if you're not, you can always revel in Verhoeven's effortless virtuosic filmmaking, the extremely brisk narrative, and the over-the-top action set pieces, where Verhoeven once again sets new standards for both bloodlust and kinetic energy.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>TOTAL RECALL is a flawed masterpiece, marred by multiple errors of aesthetic judgment and flat out absurd moments.  Nonetheless, it raises a host of wonderful questions, has a huge number of memorable moments, and is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film after the first two TERMINATOR movies.<br /><br />Although the story doesn't stay especially true to the Philip K. Dick short story upon which the movie was based --"We Can Remember It For You At Wholesale" -- it does contain the endless self-referentiality found in Dick's best stories and novels.  Construction Worker Douglas Quaid (it was Quail in the short story, but the studio thought it might be viewed as a slap at then-vice president Dan Quayle goes to a virtual reality company named Rekall that provides the imprintation of fake memories of holidays.  Having had persistent dreams of Marx, he wants a holiday to Mars.  After some prodding, he agrees to pay for some extras, namely, an adventure package, in which he will feature as the hero in an espionage tale featuring resistance fighters, alien artifacts, a brunette who looks like the one who has been featuring in his dreams, and will get to save the world.  But shortly after being placed in the equipment things start going wrong because it turns out he has already had false memories implanted.  He quickly finds himself chased by the authorities before going to Mars where he meets the brunette of his dreams and with the use of alien artifacts saves the world.  Or does he?  Any viewer will be wondering along the way whether any of this is real or whether this is just his virtual adventure holiday.  The film ends with Quaid wondering whether any of this truly was real or whether it was just the programming.  And we are given no answer.<br /><br />TOTAL RECALL was one of the very last important science fiction films made before the advent of CGI.  It was one of the last to employ primarily miniatures and matte paintings rather than SCI.  Even BABYLON 5 only three years later on television would use crude CGI for most of its special effects visuals.  In this way TOTAL RECALL is the end of an era.  Only a year later TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY would be released.  Many of its greatest special effects were CGI.  So in two straight films Schwarzenegger helped close one chapter of SF history and opened another.<br /><br />The problem with TOTAL RECALL is that there are just too many moments that don't quite work.  The inhabitants in the mutant section of underground Mars are just too comical self-indulgently mannered to contribute much to the film.  And the animatronic rebel leader Kuato, who is inextricably attached to the body of another person, is easily one of th emost ludicrous SF creations since the original THE FLY, where at the end of the film we see a fly with the head of a screaming David Hedison, as it is about to be eaten by a spider.  There are a host of terrible little lapses in judgment like this.  The most unfortunate might be the climax of the film, as Quaid has turned on generators that will oxygenate the atmosphere of Mars.  The ludicrousness comes not from the amazingly rapid creation of a breathable atmosphere for the planet, but from their completely ignoring the fact that the surface temperature of Mars is roughing that of Antarctica in the middle of winter.  The visuals of Arnold and his female friend as they roll on the surface of Mars has to be one of the silliest sights in the history of big budget films.  In real life they wouldn't have had to worry about air pressure; they would have frozen solid in only a few seconds.<br /><br />All in all, this is both a truly rewarding and an immensely frustrating film to watch.  It contains both a host of truly remarkable and utterly horrid moments.  For me the good outweighs the bad and what we see in the end is a fascinating if undeniably flawed film.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>In spite of a few ridiculous aspects (some ultra-cheezy sfx, Arnold in a dress, etc.), TOTAL RECALL is one of the better sci-fi / hyper-action movies. Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers) is the master of cinematic overkill done right. In his hands, a simple story about the reliability of memory becomes a titanic tale of conspiracy and inter-planetary adventure. Arnold is Douglas Quaid, construction worker and husband of Lori (Sharon Stone!!!). Or is he? One day, Quaid sees an ad for a company called, Rekall, that offers "trips" to places through memory implantation. Quaid wants to go to Mars, which has long been colonized, and goes through the implant procedure. Something goes wrong, and actual memories arise in Quaid's mind about Mars! Or do they? This leads to Quaid's being pursued by a nefarious gaggle of ne'er-do-wells led by one of my all-time favorite baddies, Michael Ironside (Starship Troopers, Scanners, Visiting Hours)! We end up on the martian surface for an all out explosion of bullets, blood, and mutants! Ronnie Cox (Robocop, The Beast Within) co-stars as the slimy corporate boss. Wow! This movie takes me back to those golden years when Arnold had an invincible streak of blockbusters! It's all part of his diabolical plan for global dominion!

Great with Pizza.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>This is a true science fiction film directed by master filmmaker Paul Verhoeven.  Arnold does some of his best acting and Sharon Stone delivers in a pivotal supporting role.  Right on par with Robocop and Starship Troopers.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>But nonetheless enjoyable, this is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movie! It was the second action flick for director Paul Verhoeven, who initially hit the American market with an art film starring Jeroen Krabbe called "The 4th Man". Apparently, he hasn't looked back since "Robocop".<br /><br />The movie stars Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox and a few character actors you'll recognize from TV and other films. In this story, set in the near-future, Schwarzenegger plays an unassuming construction worker, married to Stone, who is fascinated with the Martian colonies of his time. His "wife", Stone, hates Mars and tries to discourage him from thinking about it...but an ad for a "memory implant service" called "Rekall" on the ad monitors in the futuristic subway compel him to visit it for a virtual vacation to Mars as a secret agent.<br /><br />Douglas Quaid's, (Arnold's character's,) life immediately changes, as it's soon discovered that his marriage to Stone is a sham, that he has another persona, Hauser, that works for the vulgar, power hungry, robber baron ruler of Mars, Vilos Cohaagen, as a very dirty agent with a wicked sense of humor and a smarmy pesonality. He's chased by Michael Ironside and his crew all over Mars as he tries to determine just what has been done to him and what he is being used for.<br /><br />In a twist, a representative from "Rekall" visits him in the middle of all this and tries to tell him that if he doesn't come out of his induced fantasy now, he may become irrevocably altered by it. Quaid doesn't believe this, however, and after seeing a betraying sweat bead drip down the supposedly "virtual" rep's temple, he shoots him.<br /><br />Stone, playing Quaid's faux wife, Laurie, was also "brought up to Mars" by the rep to convince Quaid/Hauser that everything he has experienced before was a part of his Rekall fantasy. She ends up getting into a hand to hand battle with him after she runs into Ticotin, a rebel fighting Laurie's employer, Cohaagen, in a corridor, and he ends up shooting Laurie!<br /><br />Along the way, there are dangers from decompression from urban dome damage from the pursuit of Quaid, exposure to mutants, an adventure with a crooked, black mutant cab driver working for Cohaagen and the meeting with the old "flame" of his, named Melina, (Ticotin,) who is working for the rebels that are fighting Cohaagen for control of Mars and better living conditions on the colonized world. This is all curiously offset by a recurring and ultimately prophetic dream that Arnie keeps having of he and Ticotin being caught ouside the domes of Mars without helmets. There are quite a lot of robotics used in the film...betcha it'll take you a while to determine where it's being used....<br /><br />The story has more twists, turns, O. Henrys and vagaries than "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold", but in the end, a very good thing comes of it, but I won't spoil it for you here.<br /><br />Be warned that this movie is VERY violent,(GRUESOME in parts, even!) and is full of foul language issuing from every mouth with a substantial or walk-on part. However, it has to be one of the most enjoyable sci-fi action flicks ever made, so I highy recommend this film for mature minds who can weather dialogue and violence that almost earned it an "X" rating! The theme and incidental music, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, is fantastic, btw!</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 8/11<br />Rate: 5<br /><br />8/11: At first, I used to think that Total Recall was one of the greatest sci-fic pictures made that got overlooked. But now, I think it's a stupid picture that got overtly violent for no reason. Plus, the chase for Douglas Quaid is what slowed the pace down. Eventually, it becomes a boring tripe with very little going for it. What I liked the film the best are bits of creativity around the characters and the mystery in the identity and whether it's in reality or fantasy. Take them away, Total Recall basically has nothing going for it. Don't get me wrong: the vision of Total Recall is worth watching, and it doesn't look fake to me. Anyway, at least, it is better than The Fifth Element. Sharon Stone actually does well in Total Recall; that is as natural a performance as it could be, considering her long line of rubbish performances. All in all, I wish Paul Verhoeven spent more time in the creativity department but less on violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>This film is able to conceive the credible future space voyage aboard Mars planet !

My guess is that you do.  If you pick a DVD with the name Schwarzenegger in bold letters at the top then you know that the talent level is very low, but it will be explosive and entertaining.  `Total Recall' is just that.  The acting and plotting and general storytelling aspects of this film are marginally successful, with moments of full blown ridiculousness, but the film is exciting in all the right areas and it maintains a level of cleverness that will keep you glued.  The graphics are top notch (if not a tad on the cheesy side at times) for the time period in which this was made, and the action sequences are all pretty fun.  As far as the story is concerned, well a lot of Arnold's films seemed to be cut from the same mold, and this is no different.  Still, if you have a lazy Sunday afternoon prepared for it, `Total Recall' can bring with it a fairly good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Set in the year 2084, a man goes to Mars via a memory implant and discovers the truth about himself.

Its Sid the Elf here to review Total Recall. We just can't get enough Arnold. Just hearing the guy talk is enough for a few stars. However, this review will not be the typical recounting of cheesey special effects, and how the plot cannot be possible because of the time-space continuim. This is Sid the Elf baby! You know what that means? Thats right: It's turbo time! If we, Sid the Elf, are reviewing this film, chances are it is pretty sweet and really funny. In Total Recall, Arnold plays Douglas Quaid. This is one of the coolest parts in movie history. He is a good-natured guy who will, if you cross him, rip your arms off and beat you to death with them. He is an adventerous and somewhat discontented construction worker in 2084 who has a strange fixation with Mars and wants to vacation there. That would be like wanting to vacation in Detroit now. His wife, played by "just starting to become hot" Sharron Stone, does not want to do that vacation, oddly. So, Arnold decides to get a vacation memory of Mars implanted, which aparently you will be able to do. Yeah, awesome. So, it turns out that his life now, as a construction worker, is a memory implantation. He's actually a secret agent on Mars, fighting a dictator who sells oxygen to the citizens. And his wife is a double agent who tries to kill him. Was this a political comentary on where America is heading? Sid doesn't know, but he does know that this movie rocked. It was an awesome premise for a movie, and it actually was the perfect vehicle for Arnold. This flick had 35 soundboard lines. Yes, 35. That's good enough to break into the Arnold movie pantheon. We even thought Total Recall was in the same league as Predator.<br /><br />You can't argue Arnold's prowess. His hillarious voice and rippling muscles have a magnitism that can't be touched. He is totally dominating Sid's reviews right now. Total Recall is too good to not give the Sid the Elf Seal of Approval, 5 stars, or Joe Bob's Drive-In Totals. So, here it goes:<br /><br />2 neck snappings(1 with a foot, which we doubt is even possible. B-alert!)<br /><br />6 objects implanted in heads<br /><br />1- 3 breasted chick...<br /><br />and roughly 386 hillarious Arnold faces (note: from now on, when someone is straining so much that it looks like their teeth are trying to run away from their mouth that face will be known as the Arnold Total Recall face, the Douglas Quaid face, or the I Am Quaid face.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who has been dreaming about Mars at night.

It plays on reality and virtuality, on recollection and fantasy, on what is true and what is maybe true or untrue. That game is at times surprising because there is no solution to a real illusion or a false reality.<br /><br />Mars is a paradise for mining corporations that have total and free hands to do ,what they want, which means exploit those who work, do not control environmental conditions so that more and more mutants appear that are trapped in some zones where they can survive if they manage to bring in some income through gambling or prostitution. The new slaves of this future world, free slaves that can die by a simple decision of the boss of the planet, the boss of the main mining corporation: just cut their air and they die.<br /><br />Beyond that it would be spoilers and spoilers, but what is interesting is that the danger this world is obliged to face is the greed for money of course but also for power of those who are supposed to manage the planet. The danger is not outside once again but inside, inside the system that uses free enterprise to be competitive, to the point we may wonder if these films are not speaking for public control of these natural resources.<br /><br />And yet they are not because public control of natural resources remove any possible choice and competition and then corruption is dominant. We can note that this film does not show any political personnel and we can wonder if that is not a picture of sovietism, the good old but dead thanks God sovietism where the political personnel had full control of the economy of the country, which destroyed the system eventually because they maybe were good authoritarian of not tyrannical politicians but they were null economists.<br /><br />The second element is that some extraterrestrials or aliens had come to the planet before terrestrial humans and had found and built the solution to produce oxygen and an atmosphere by melting the underground ice and breaking it up into gases, Oxygen and Hydrogen, but the most lucrative commerce on Mars is the sale of air, so you can imagine this alien invention and technology is banned. But once again the danger is not outside, in fact the solution and salvation are coming from these aliens.<br /><br />Once again, many people considered in the 1980s these films were Cold War films justifying the capitalist system and encouraging all kinds of segregation. And today we are able to look at these films with different eyes. Of course they are entertaining films but their ideological meaning is more mixed, ambiguous and I would say that the main fink, traitor is a mutant, black what's more though the salvation comes from a strange mutant as the main leader and many others who finally find some courage to oppose the mining establishment.<br /><br />It is this ambiguity that probably makes these films more durable than John Wayne's westerns that are all openly racist and segregative and in no way open to any criticism of the colonial system that ethnically cleansed the Indians to let a wild jungle take over that John Wayne tries to idealize and make shiny and bright, admirable in one word.<br /><br />I love gangsters but I can't help it I prefer those who get them down, especially when the gangsters are on the side of the law: corruption, you say?<br /><br />Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>The director miscast the two female leads.

The studio's original Blu-Ray was a poor, early-format effort, and this new AVC encoded 1080p transfer is a huge upgrade by comparison, even though the film itself doesn't appear flawless (with all the optical effects, it's no surprise that there's something of a slightly "dirty" aspect to the entire transfer). That said, the lack of DNR is quite welcome and the overall look hugely satisfying, with the transfer closely resembling Studio Canal's superior European Blu-Ray releases of the film (in fact it seems to be a new encoding of that older master). The DTS MA audio nicely represents Goldsmith's score, while extras - none of which were contained on the prior Blu-Ray - are rounded up from Lionsgate's old DVD releases.<br /><br />These include a chatty Verhoeven-Schwarzenegger commentary, which is wide-ranging and most interesting when it divulges the rocky development of the film, particularly the Bruce Beresford-directed version that was days away from shooting with star Patrick Swayze before DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group went under. There's also talk about the proposed "Total Recall 2" sequel that was supposed to adapt "Minority Report," while an interview with Verhoeven, 2001 "Imaging `Total Recall'" and special effects documentaries, the trailer, a photo gallery, and a restoration comparison round out a fine budget-priced Blu-Ray that's unquestionably better than the release that preceded it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K5IMGDCDBCNF.html">A3K5IMGDCDBCNF</a><br/><p>Total Recall is one of those movies I can watch over and over and never get sick of.  It is what every true Arnold fan wants in an Arnold flick.  And aside from being one of Arnold's best films it is a very great sci-fi flick period.<br /><br />Arnold plays everyman Douglas Quaid, a guy living an average life on the near future earth who is obsessed with the idea of going to Mars(which is colonized).  He decides to go to a futuristic company called Recall, which sells it's customers memories of vacations they did not really take.  Quaid decides to do it and while the salesman is making his pitch he poses the question, &quot;what is the same about every vaction you have ever taken?&quot; The answer: You.  So Quaid buys the secret agent package and that is when the action begins.  Suddenly everyone is out to get Quaid and he can't figure it out, all he knows is he has to get his &quot;a** to Mars.&quot;  He does and the film really takes off with mutants, rebels, women, corruption, double crossing, heavy carnage, planet saving, and Arnold, smack in the middle of all of it. <p>The story in summary can actually be found within the movie, which is a very unusual plot device, but it works in this film.  The guy at Recall says by the time this is over you will kill the bad guys, get the girl, and save the planet.  So is Total Recall a dream or a reality.  This question is one of the things that makes it such an engaging movie because you don't know.  Really though the best part of this film is Arnold.  He is in tip top form in this film and it is certainly one of his best.  The character allows him all the elements to shine, odds against him, guys always trying to fight him, lots of guns, and terrific one-liners. Paul Verhoeven(Robocop, Basic Instict) has crafted a awesome film.  The set direction is great and it makes the fantastic action that much better.  Sure Verhoeven may get a little carried away with violent nature of his action, but would anyone really want this film any other way?  Not me.<p>Total Recall is a blast.  On an additional note I just picked up the DVD Collector's Edition and it is a must have for fans.  The commentary with Verhoeven and Arnold is hilarious and the making of's are very well done.  This is one of those films that will become a classic over time because that is what it is, CLASSIC.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoeven's stylish non-stop action TOTAL RECALL is one of Arnold's better movies.  Featuring the now classic "consider this a divorce" scene, TOTAL RECALL bristles with electrical tension and brutally explicit action and violence.  Based on a short story by Philip Dick, the movie focuses on Arnie, whose memories have been wiped away and when he discovers that, it leads him to Mars and confrontations with nasty guys that want him dead.  Considering that this is a 1990 film, the special effects, set design, costuming, etc. are very impressive, as is the late Jerry Goldsmith's atmospheric score.<br /><br />Arnie is Arnie, who has never made us think of him as a serious actor, but this is his kind of movie, and he is surrounded with some competent supporting performers:  Rachel Ticotin as Melina, his love from his previous life, who exudes a smoldering sensuality; the then lesser known Sharon Stone, who plays Arnie's "wife" with a mixture of flirtatious sexuality and out and out viciousness; the irrepressible Michael Ironside, the consummate villain chewing up the scenery; and Ronny Cox as the nasty Coalhagen, who is masterminding all the trouble on Mars to meet his own excessive needs.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you can enjoy more than once, to savor the lush topography of Mars and Sharon Stone getting her just rewards.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>Though I've read a fair bit of Philip K. Dick, whose short story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" was adapted by a whole mess of people for this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film, I've neither read this piece nor any others that have been adapted into film.  Strange, eh?  So I come at this, as I did on first seeing it new 20 years ago, knowing a bit about the basic ideas behind it and most of Dick's fiction, but without being able to comment too much on the work as an adaptation.  Perhaps that's for the best; I doubt Dick would have approved of any of his work being turned into an Arnie slugfest; then again, on a second viewing and watched carefully, there's definitely more than meets the eye.<br /><br />First off, not surprisingly if you're familiar with the author at all, this is a story about identity and the nature of reality.  Douglas Quaid (Arnie) is a construction worker on Earth in 2048 who keeps having nightmares about Mars.  His wife Lori (Sharon Stone) worries about him and tries to keep his mind off these regular dreams, but to no avail.  Quaid decides to visit "Rekall", a company that provides dream vacations that can be implanted into your memories directly, giving a sensation every bit as real as if you'd actually taken the physical trip.  Or so they claim.  But something goes wrong as Quaid is strapped into the chair, waiting for his dream of being a secret agent on Mars to begin.  He starts convulsing and going nuts, and soon he is sedated and dropped in a cab to be sent home.  Now his real nightmare begins, as first his best friend from work (Robert Costanzo) tries to kill him, followed by his wife - who claims she's an agent sent to monitor him.  Turns out that Mr. Quaid really was an agent on Mars, and he's had his memory wiped and a new persona created by Cohagen, the director of the Mars colony, a ruthless dictator type played by (who else) Ronny Cox.  Soon Cohagen's chief henchman Richter (Michael Ironside) and a crew are out to bring Quaid in, and Quaid is on the run through the antiseptic city, and then on to the domes of Mars where he works to find out the secrets that Cohagen is trying to surpress.<br /><br />Though the "is this real or is it a dream" theme does recur at various times in the film and is always an uneasy current running through most of the narrative, at heart Total Recall is a non-stop action/thriller, and a pretty solid one overall.  The ace supporting cast, which also includes Rachel Ticotin as an apparent former lover of the amnesiac Quaid on Mars and Mel Johnson Jr as a wisecracking cab driver, manages to outshine our hero on many occasions, which is fine as Arnold's physical presence isn't really as important here as it usually is.  This is clearly a role that could have been readily adapted for any number of actors (Patrick Swayze was one of those considered for it at one time), but Arnold's stardom helped get it made, and helped raise a budget that allowed for some fairly impressive sets and effects.  The look of the film is industrial and at times antiseptic, and in fact it may look pretty cheap if you're used to the high-gloss sheen of most new big-budget action films, but it serves Verhoeven's purpose of showing a future-world in which the have-nots still seemingly far outnumber the haves, and the lives of the lower classes aren't worth a hill of beans to the few ruthless men in charge.  There's less room for the director's typically satirical and jaundiced vision here, but it's certainly not missing.<br /><br />Ultimately the big climactic last few sequences ring just a little hollow to me and the last scene in particular is just silly as hell.  But Arnold's last line and a few other touches here and there do help to remind us that we may be in a dream the whole time, and who would want to dream of saving the world in a prosaic, ordinary, believable way?<br /><br />Another spectacularly good and original score by Jerry Goldsmith here; the man could practically do no wrong as far as I've been able to tell.  The "making of/behind the scenes" feature here is one of the better examples I've seen; this comes very, very close to being deserving of a "5" from me, but sometimes the flaws need as much recognition as the merits.  In any case, among Arnold's 5 or so best films I think, and I'm sure I'll return to it again in less than 20 years this time.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>I was so stoked for this DVD to come out.  One of the funnest movies Paul Verhoven ever made besides his work with Robocop.  So far, it's the only modern movie about Mars that has a decent story and has a great "realism" factor that still holds well after the credits have long since rolled.  I saw the extras listed on Amazon, I saw the illustration picture that showed the product but when I finally received it in the mail, low and behold-I get a round metal box thingy that holds the DVD.  The stupidity of this is that I have no place for this thing to go in my DVD library!  I have since learned that Artisan is releasing a version with a keepcase in the next few months which is the same thing they did with T2 (the original packaging couldn't hold both discs securly without that cheesy metal frame to go with it).  I am tired of this lame packaging Artisan is coming out with and from now on, I plan to buy DVD's at the lowest price from other retailers I know have a decent product I can actually look at before I buy!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>TOTAL RECALL is a flawed masterpiece, marred by multiple errors of aesthetic judgment and flat out absurd moments.  Nonetheless, it raises a host of wonderful questions, has a huge number of memorable moments, and is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film after the first two TERMINATOR movies.<br /><br />Although the story doesn't stay especially true to the Philip K. Dick short story upon which the movie was based --"We Can Remember It For You At Wholesale" -- it does contain the endless self-referentiality found in Dick's best stories and novels.  Construction Worker Douglas Quaid (it was Quail in the short story, but the studio thought it might be viewed as a slap at then-vice president Dan Quayle goes to a virtual reality company named Rekall that provides the imprintation of fake memories of holidays.  Having had persistent dreams of Marx, he wants a holiday to Mars.  After some prodding, he agrees to pay for some extras, namely, an adventure package, in which he will feature as the hero in an espionage tale featuring resistance fighters, alien artifacts, a brunette who looks like the one who has been featuring in his dreams, and will get to save the world.  But shortly after being placed in the equipment things start going wrong because it turns out he has already had false memories implanted.  He quickly finds himself chased by the authorities before going to Mars where he meets the brunette of his dreams and with the use of alien artifacts saves the world.  Or does he?  Any viewer will be wondering along the way whether any of this is real or whether this is just his virtual adventure holiday.  The film ends with Quaid wondering whether any of this truly was real or whether it was just the programming.  And we are given no answer.<br /><br />TOTAL RECALL was one of the very last important science fiction films made before the advent of CGI.  It was one of the last to employ primarily miniatures and matte paintings rather than SCI.  Even BABYLON 5 only three years later on television would use crude CGI for most of its special effects visuals.  In this way TOTAL RECALL is the end of an era.  Only a year later TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY would be released.  Many of its greatest special effects were CGI.  So in two straight films Schwarzenegger helped close one chapter of SF history and opened another.<br /><br />The problem with TOTAL RECALL is that there are just too many moments that don't quite work.  The inhabitants in the mutant section of underground Mars are just too comical self-indulgently mannered to contribute much to the film.  And the animatronic rebel leader Kuato, who is inextricably attached to the body of another person, is easily one of th emost ludicrous SF creations since the original THE FLY, where at the end of the film we see a fly with the head of a screaming David Hedison, as it is about to be eaten by a spider.  There are a host of terrible little lapses in judgment like this.  The most unfortunate might be the climax of the film, as Quaid has turned on generators that will oxygenate the atmosphere of Mars.  The ludicrousness comes not from the amazingly rapid creation of a breathable atmosphere for the planet, but from their completely ignoring the fact that the surface temperature of Mars is roughing that of Antarctica in the middle of winter.  The visuals of Arnold and his female friend as they roll on the surface of Mars has to be one of the silliest sights in the history of big budget films.  In real life they wouldn't have had to worry about air pressure; they would have frozen solid in only a few seconds.<br /><br />All in all, this is both a truly rewarding and an immensely frustrating film to watch.  It contains both a host of truly remarkable and utterly horrid moments.  For me the good outweighs the bad and what we see in the end is a fascinating if undeniably flawed film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger and more star in this 1990 sci-fi film.<br />In 2084, A construction worker gets an implanted memory<br />and learns he may be an agent.

The movie is the main ingredient/bottom line to all this equipment! Being a videophile I am obsessed in getting the best quality picture and sound available! So my reviews will concentrate on the total DVD package.<br />TOTAL RECALL is my (#2nd) Home Theatre DVD Review. This is the movie's second release and the first was fair but they got it right on this &quot;Special Limited Edition&quot;.<br />Now this DVD is Digitally ReMastered (Picture &amp; Sound). It is enhanced for Widescreen (16:9 Aspect Ratio) TV's &amp; HDTV's. The movies picture is one of the best (sharpest clarity) I've ever seen on home DVD. NOTE: 480p = 480 horizontal lines (Digital) of Progressive Scan (p) - which is basically a line doubler and using COMPONENT VIDEO cable for the best picture quality. Regular DVD players have 480i = 480 horizontal lines (Analog) and use either COMPOSITE or S-VIDEO Cables. For more information see my SD-6200 &amp; MV3CV-2M reviews.<br />Simply put this is a scifi Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie of the highest quality (special effects, story line, casting &amp; color). He is caught between a boring life and the strange desire to be an action hero on Mars. He sees a TV ad referring to a brain implant journey to Mars. This is the latest Travel scheme fad of the time. A mental exercise in time and space. (pretty clever huh?) The name of the company is &quot;Rekall&quot;. This is just the beginning of a great DVD journey!!!! (Parental Guidance required - some graphic violence and mutant make-up).<br />The colors are absolutely beautiful, so vivid. The Sound is so crystal clear. (5.1)<br />Extras are abundant and delightful including a Commentary Track with Schwarzeneggers many fond memories. This DVD is a great value and total eye &amp; ear candy!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>A DVD I have in my collection mainly because I'm a big Sci-Fi fan. No one scene really stands out in my mind, none of the scenes were great, but none were terrible either. They work well taken as a whole.

An  interesting plot to a degree that makes you wonder what is supposed to be  real and what is imaginary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>A MAN TAKES A DREAM VACATION TO MARS.

Now, a group of Mars Intelligence agents are out to kill Doug, including his own wife, and the only people who can help him are a mysterious woman named Melina and an army of rebellious mutants. The movie manages to keep you guessing whether these things are actually happening to Quaid, or if he is having an elaborate Mars-influenced dream?

I didn't understand the story from the beginning, though I saw this pile of junk from start to finish. With an excellent cast and the director of "Robocop" behind the camera, I thought this movie would be so much better than it really was. It was such a piece of crap. Mind-boggling story. Total b.s. of a movie. not worth all the f---ing hype. "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" is a helluva better action/sci-fi movie than this turgid waste of an excuse for gratuitous violence and nudity. Rated Crappholy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>Be aware, there is more than one Blu-ray release of this movie; at the time I bought this movie, Amazon listed three Blu-ray "Total Recall" releases:  2006,  2007 (Special Edition),  and 2012 (Mind-Bending Edition).  If you are new to Amazon, you may not have noticed that the reviews are all lumped together;  when checking out the reviews, you will find the version title just above the review's text.<br /><br />Lion Gate's 2012 Blu-ray release looks fine and I have no issues with this product.<br /><br />If you have never seen Arnold Schwarzenegger's version of "Total Recall", there are two things you should know.  Firstly, it is great science fiction.  It delves into the question of just who are we?  Are we the sum of our memories?  In "Total Recall" someone has replaced the memories of the main character, who believes himself to be a man named Quaid;  he still has the same skills, but his personality is different.<br /><br />Secondly, you should know this is a violent movie;  how violent?  There are many scenes in which you could use the words: blood, bullets, and breaking glass in their descriptions.  I counted 17 violent scenes, 16 which involve gunfire and one scene where death was meted out with sharp pieces of equipment and a fire axe.<br /><br />In spite of the violence, it is a well done action-movie, so riveting, so fast paced, that there is no time to get another popcorn. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 4.  Subtitles & Languages: English, French, and German;  Spanish is not included.  Bonus Features:  Schwarzenegger & Director commentary,  Director interview,  Special Effects,  Trailer,  Documentary "Imagining Total Recall", Restoration comparison, and Photo Gallery.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Well paced, well done science fiction movie.  The story uses Arnold just right, and surrounds him with great actors.  Based on an excellent story, this movie involves a man who starts to regain memories of being on Mars.  Soon he finds that he is so much more than just a construction worker, that his whole life was just a lie.  Tons of action and plenty of eye candy, this dvd is a nice print and a good addition to any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>What if you could have memories implanted?  What if the implanted memories were so real that you could not tell the difference between the implanted memories and reality?  What if you went to a place that implanted such memories and when you woke up, you discovered that you had lost your sense of reality and you no longer knew who you were?<br /><br />Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a laborer living an apparent life of ease (and luxury - laborers must be paid really well in 2084) with his beautiful wife Lori (Sharon Stone).  Life is good for Douglas and Lori, until Douglas gets it into his head that he wants to take a trip to Mars.  Of course, Douglas is unable to go to Mars (Lori does not want to emigrate to Mars), so Douglas heads off to Rekall to get a brain implant.<br /><br />Implanted memories are no big deal.  You go in, they put you under, you get an implanted memory, and you go home thinking you had a great time on Mars.  Douglas chose to be a spy and have a beautiful girlfriend.  Unfortunately, the friendly folks at Rekall discover that Douglas had already had an implant and their attempt to implant a new memory was creating problems in Douglas's brain.  However, the people at Rekall are able to cover up the problem and Douglas seems to walk away from Rekall without problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Douglas, his wife is quite upset that Douglas went to Rekall.  So upset that she works Douglas over.  The next thing Douglas knows, a bunch of guys with really big guns are trying to blow him away and he is running for his life.<br /><br />Douglas can only do one thing.  He heads for Mars and the answers to his questions.  Things on Mars get even more interesting.  A man with a dictator's power, Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox, "Deliverance" and "Beverly Hills Cop"), controls Mars.  Quaid seems caught between mutants, Cohaagen and Cohaagen's henchmen, led by Richter (Michael Ironside, "Scanners," "Watchers," and "Starship Troopers").  Of course, Quaid's murderous wife is still running around.  Then there are the aliens.  You will have to watch.<br /><br />This movie is filled with action and allows you enough time to wonder what is real and what is fantasy, nearly to the end of the movie.  I thought the special effects were quite good for 1990.  There are places where you can easily see that a set is a miniature, but other miniatures are beautiful and wonderfully meshed with full-sized sets.<br /><br />Director Paul Verhoeven and a team of writers did a wonderful job of building on a 1966 Philip K. Dick short story, "We Can Remember It for You."  Even with some dated effects and styles, the movie still plays well, especially once the movie shifts to Mars.  I absolutely loved the action-packed ending, wondering just how Quaid was going to survive.  Fans of Philip K. Dick, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin and science fiction movies have to see this excellent movie, one of Arnold's best.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>Total Recall, Paul Verhoeven's fascinating (if sometimes very violent) 1990 science fiction/thriller examined the boundaries between reality and illusion. It also established Arnold Schwarzenegger as a true force in the action adventure genre, proving that the former bodybuilder could act in a more challenging role than Conan or the Terminator.<p>Inspired by Philip K. Dick's story "We Can Dream It For You Wholesale," the screenplay by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon (Alien) and Gary Goldman weaves a clever tapestry of story threads that revolve around the question of what is reality and what is a dream, especially if the mind could be manipulated artificially?<p>Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone) and living in a city perhaps 100 years in the future.  By this time, Earth is embroiled in a major war between the Northern and Southern Blocs, space travel is as routine as catching a bus, and Mars has been colonized. Its governor, a ruthless dictator named Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) is providing the Northern bloc with essential raw materials and suppressing a bloody insurrection led by mutants.<p>Quaid is obsessed with a fantasy of Mars -- in his dreams he's there, in the company of a mysterious brunette (Rachel Ticotin), much to Lori's chagrin. Even as he claims it's just a fantasy and that Lori's the only woman in his life, he still presses the issue of Mars, going as far to suggest leaving Earth and moving to the Red Planet.  Lori attempts to reason with Quaid, telling him he'd "hate it there. It's dry, it's dusty, it's boring."  Reluctantly, Quaid relents and goes off to work as usual.<p>But after seeing a commercial for "virtual vacations" on a subway TV monitor, Quaid decides to visit Rekall, where false memories are implanted into customers' minds "for the memory of a lifetime."  With the aid of drugs and hi-tech gizmos, the perfect vacation -- a ski trip, a visit to an exotic beach, or even a trip to Mars -- can be "remembered" as if it had really happened.  Even better, as a smarmy salesman tells Quaid, one can even change personalities and take the "Ego Trip" and become, for a little while, someone else.  Intrigued, Quaid selects -- you guessed it -- the trip to Mars with the secret agent Ego Trip.<p>Verhoeven's films are not known for their quiet subtlety; indeed, they tend to be in-your-face collages of mordant wit, wry one-liners, and -- in his science fiction films (Robocop, Starship Troopers) -- violence.  Yet, when watching this movie on DVD and listening to the audio commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarznegger, I was surprised by the complexity of this film's plot.  Yes, it's action packed and it's an "Ah-nuld" showcase full of droll one-liners ("Consider this a divorce!"), but it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  The movie's eye-popping (pun intended) special effects are amazing, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is thrilling.<p>The Artisan Special Edition of Total Recall is loaded with various extra features and showcases this above-average sci-fi thriller in a newly remastered widescreen version. The picture is sharp and the sound is excellently clear.  Considering that Artisan is also behind the spectacular DVDs for the first two Terminator films, this is to be expected!<p>I strongly recommend Total Recall to both Schwarzenegger and science fiction fans alike; its underlying storyline is intriguing, and Arnold has rarely been in better form as an actor!</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoeven took it on the chin from fans of Philip K. Dick for this film (just as he did from Heinlein fans for his odd take on _Starship Troopers_).<p>But this nonstop SF action-thriller -- besides being, as its legion of fans will attest, a helluva lot of fun to watch -- is actually a fair translation to the screen of Dick's 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'. I won't give away any spoilers here, but watch it carefully: are you _sure_ that by the end of the movie you know what's real and what isn't?<p>Readers of Dick's brilliant short story probably wouldn't have cast Arnold in the lead role, either. But all that proves is that we aren't Paul Verhoeven. The movie works.<p>Arnold is in terrific form here as Douglas Quaid, a guy who wants to go to Mars so badly that the subject has become an obsession. He nips off to Rekal, Incorporated, to get a set of false memories implanted, and the rest is SF film history.<p>The special effects are extremely good and the Martian landscape is pretty well realized (although some portions of the 'science' part of the science fiction are decidedly lacking). The supporting cast is magnificent, from Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin to Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox. As we expect from Verhoeven, the dialogue includes quite a bit of profanity and the action includes a lot of gory violence. But if you weren't okay with that, you wouldn't be looking for an Arnold movie, would you?<p>I have the Special Limited Edition (the one with the Mars-shaped metal box). The 'special' features are nice; Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven provide some good commentary and the 'making-of' documentary is worth watching once.<p>But the real star is the movie itself, which (despite some cliches) manages to stay fresh after numerous repeated viewings. Pop it in and crank it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is a simple laborer (living like a wealthy guy) until he visits a place that will give him the memories of a vacation to Mars.  He pays a little extra so that he can be a spy and save the world.  But during the process it turns out that he really is an agent and they have unlocked his memories.  Suddenly he is on the run as friends and family turn out to be other than he originally thought.  A message from his former self tells him he has to go back to Mars.<br /><br />Once on Mars he is still on the run.  Here he encounters rebels trying to stop the mining concern that controls every aspect of the planet.  But while trying to save his own life and that of a previous love, Arnold discovers a Mars secret that could end the tyranny.  But in the end Arnold has to wonder is it all real or just part of the artificial vacation package he purchased.<br /><br />A pretty good film that does manage to deal with Philip K. Dick's ideas regarding the nature of reality.  I never understood how the simple laborer had such a glamorous life before the action begins but it doesn't really ruin anything.  The action is good and the effects have stood up fairly well although CGI could improve some of the facial effects.  All in all this film stands up after time and is still fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>I wish Amazon would add sub scales for PQ, AQ, overall movie and other criteria, so that, with the advent of Blu-Ray, technical as well as cinematic aspects would be rated separately. What if you love a film, but hate the transfer?<br /><br />I had never seen all of Total Recall, and as a fan of older Sci-Fi and action films, I thought the effects were fun and advanced for the time period. Despite Arnold's mediocre acting skills, I am still a fan of his films, because they're so "over the top" and action packed. This film from the 90's was a cool "throwback" for me, and I enjoyed the sound and visual effects, as well as the story line of implanted memories, vicarious living etc. The storyline has often been mimicked by movies that followed in the next decade and for historical purposes and perspective this film is interesting as its themes remain relevant. Seeing Sharon Stone in action sequences was funny but effective, and it was cool to see her in some of her earlier work.<br /><br />The sound was powerful but the transfer was very dirty and there was significant noise and specs that littered the print. The colors were not as vibrant, as I had hoped, and having seen some much older films, that have been restored (Poltergeist, for instance), this older film's transfer is quite disappointing. Still the picture was clear and on a 50" Panasonic Plasma screen, sitting about 15-20 ft back, it still was a clean/clear experience. For the price of under $12, which I paid, it remains a fun and thought provoking sci-fi film for my collection. It is not demo material, but for its story worth a look for fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>Total Recall is a milestone in Scince Fiction Cinema that helped boost the careers of actor Arnold Scwarzenegger, actress Sharon Stone, as well as director Paul Verhoeven, who first got our attention with his other Sci-Fi Masterpiece; Robocop.<p>Certainly purists will pick the film apart, but as Leanord Nimoy once said in Star Trek II, &quot;It is easier to destroy than to create&quot;.  Total Recall works on two levels: a dream or a reality, but whichever way you choose to watch the movie, both levels make sense to you.  That in itself is an accomplishment.  Most sci-fi's these days can't even work on one level, let alone two.  <p>If you've been holding out for a Special Edition of Total Recall, you can finally cash in your chips because it has finally arrived, in a circular metal tin, shaped to look like Mars no less.  I'm sure that some people will have mixed feelings on the special features (the &quot;Recall's Virtual Vacations&quot; are nothing really special) only because other releases like the T2 Special Edition have made us more picky as far as a good S.E. and a bad one.  Total Recall extras are in no way bad.  The 30 minute &quot;Imagining Total Recall&quot; documentary is well made and delivers a lot of insight.  It's also a retrospective documentary, with both Arnold and Mr. Verhoeven looking back at the film 10 years after the fact.  This is of course defined more closely in the audio commentary by both the star and the director.  If you bought the Collector's Edition of Conan The Barbarian and enjoyed Arnold's audio commentary for that movie, you'll most assuredly enjoy this one..although there was no mention of the two working together on a sequel which has been talked about for years.<p>The disappointment from many is that Total Recall, at one time, had a longer cut which made it even more excessively violent.  From fear of receiving and X-rating, the film was cut down to the version we all know and love.  Why hasn't Paul Verhoeven added those scenes back in now or at least given us a deleted scenes section?  Considering that Robocop and Basic Instinct (his two other successful movies) have already gotten the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; treatment, it is indeed a wonder why Total Recall was forgotten in that aspect.  Not that I'm complaining, but considering that the T2 Special Edition gave us three different versions of that movie to watch, would it have been so bad to do the same here?  <p>As far as the picture and sound is concerned I don't have any real complaints whatsoever.  The picture is crisp, clean and clear and the sound plays great on my sound system.  Perhaps one day a two disc set of Total Recall will be released.  Yeah, and maybe one day Paul Verhoeven will release a Special Unrated Edition of &quot;Showgirls&quot;, complete with commentary. Until then.<p>&quot;Get your ass to Mars&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger as Hauser</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>A clever Arnie science fiction thriller "Total Recall" maintains the over-the-top vibe of Paul Verhoven's ("Robocop", "Basic Instinct", "Starship Troopers", "Showgirls")other American films; the films feature an absurd almost pornographic level of violence, tongue-in-cheek humor and a clever plot twist.<br /><br />The story for the five people who haven't seen it is based on Phil Dick's (Dick wrote the novels that were adapted into the films "Blade Runner", "A Scanner Darkly" and has had numerous stories turned into films)story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale", features Arnie as construction worker Doug Quaid who feels like something is missing in his life. Against his wife's (Sharon Stone) advice Quaid goes to REKALL a company that specalizes in memory implant vacations. Quaid elects the Martian vacation package where he'll be an undercover operative helping to liberate the Mars colony. There's one hitch--it turns out that Quaid MAY very well be the character he was going to pretend to be on vacation and that REKALL's attempt to implant the memory uncovers a suppressed one.<br /><br />Ronny Cox gives a deliciously over-the-top performance as the bad guy here that rivals his slimy, evil performance in "Robocop". Sharon Stone isn't hard on the eyes here and Arnie gives a solid performance as Quaid (although I can imagine a VERY different film if the original star attached at one point--Richard Drefyus--had been cast and someone a bit more subtle had directed). "Total Recall" is a fun, loud, violent flick typical of what you'd expect from Arnie and from the 1990's but this version, well, it looks pretty awful.<br /><br />Update for 2012 Edition:<br /><br />The "Mind-Bending Edition" is a marked improvement over the original subpart Blu-ray release. The image quality improves with a sharper, more detailed picture. Having said that, the effects sequence have a softer quality to them which is not atypical for a film from the 80's using pre-CGI visual effects. The color is also improved here but I seem to remember the film having bolder colors in theaters although I should note that it's been a long, long time since I saw this in theaters and that memory may be "colored" by seeing it on television with boosted color values that weren't part of the original presentation.<br /><br />This edition features an often amusing commentary track (Arnie's habit of describing the action isn't as annoying as it might appear to be at first listen--it actually is quite amusing to hear him describe the action at times on the screen)while director Verhoeven's commentary track is pretty good although far less animated than, say, "Starship Troopers" or "Showgirls".<br /><br />We get a "making of" featurette as well as a restoration comparison, stills gallery and the original trailer. Compared to the previous edition, this version is positively filled to the brim with special features. We also get featurettes on the various effects in the film while the only one missing that I can think of is on the production history of the film (this is one of two projects that the late Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett were working on at the same time--the other one was "Alien").<br /><br />I'd recommend this new edition (the review for the previous version is below).<br /><br />PREVIOUS EDITION (2006):<br /><br />I'm saddened to report that this is one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I've ever seen; Lion's Gate's version looks like it was upscaled from a standard DVD or pulled from the same regular definition source. The film looks soft with fine detail often lost in the murky looking Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />I'd recommend skipping this edition which even for $9 (amazon's price when I wrote this review) isn't worth it. It's ugly looking. Wait until Lion's Gate elects to upgrade this with a better looking transfer from a better source or go for the UK edition which looks better than this pathetic excuse for a Blu-ray. Skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Total Recall is EASILY one of the funniest and most violent science fiction movies around!  It's also one of the overall best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of all time.  It's so good that I can't possibly write a review comprehensive enough; I'll just honor Arnold and Total Recall as best I can.<br /><br />Arnold is married to Sharon Stone - at possibly her sexiest shortly before exploding onto the scene in Basic Instinct - but wants to go on vacation to Mars because of recurring dreams in which he cavorts with a mysterious and gorgeous brunette named Melina (Rachel Ticotin at her most delicious).  Instead, he goes to a company that does mind implants, providing retroactive vacations to various parts of the solar system.  It's just too bad that they interfere with previous government sponsored brainwashing.<br /><br />Eventually he learns that he was a former agent on Mars, gets a video from himself in the past in which he tells himself to remove a spherically shaped tracking device from his own nose, despite the fact that the device is three times the circumference of a nostril.  He also tells himself, "Git yo as* to Mahrs."<br /><br />It is on Mars where he sees the following: a mutant lady with three boobs, a knife and machine gun wielding midget hooker, oxygen-depletion that has led to horribly disfigured freaks, and a philosophical, prophetic, baby mutant that grows out of another man's chest, clearly inspired by Danny Devito in Arnold's previous movie Twins.<br /><br />And the great thing is he manages to see all of this as secret agents are chasing him and trying to kill him.  One memorable scene has Arnold on a crowded escalator where he uses some poor guy as a meatshield during a gun battle, tossing his carcass aside after it's served its purpose.  It's as bloody and gory as scenes come, and a signature of the explicitly violent and/or sexual content master Paul Verhoeven.<br /><br />With the mystery uncovered, and the bad guys defeated, one last bit of drama subsides as Arnold has to somehow use an alien device to unleash hell on the Mars atmosphere, delivering relief to all the planet's inhabitants.<br /><br />There are a ton of groin shots, perpetual single-bullet head shots, a decapitation, and a mechanical but realistic, removable, exploding fake face/head helmet thing.  I know it sounds unlikely, but you just have to trust me.  Of course, there are several classic Arnold one-liners.  For instance, just after he executes his former pseudo-wife, Arnold deadpans, "Consider dat a divohrce."  The best of all one-liners is when he kills someone with a drill and yells, "SCREW YOU!!"<br /><br />If you watch this and fail to find something interesting, then you simply don't like movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Total Recall,&quot; directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a stunning blend of high-concept science fiction, action, and humor. The script is based on the story &quot;We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,&quot; by legendary science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.<p>In the film, an Earthman named Quaid (a good performance by Arnold Schwarzeneggar) goes to have artificial memories of an exciting vacation to Mars implanted into his brain. But the process goes horribly wrong, and Quaid ends up on Mars in the midst of conspiracy and unrest.<p>&quot;Total Recall&quot; contains truly amazing special effects. Combined with the set design and some memorable mutant makeup designs, this is one of the most visually stunning science fiction films ever made. There is plenty of humor in the film, often in the form of snappy one-liners and weird sight gags. The performances are very good; I was especially impressed by Ronny Cox as the ruthless Martian dictator. And everything is well complemented by the big, booming orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith.<p>The intense violence may turn off some viewers. But if you have a high tolerance for cinematic brutality, give &quot;Total Recall&quot; a try. It's a witty, inventive, and visually impressive achievement in science fiction filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is uneasy.  Things are not right in the world.  Sure, he has a nice place to live, a decent job in construction, and a beautiful wife (Sharon Stone) -- but he has a feeling he is missing out on something, that there is something false about his life, and that his destiny is elsewhere, maybe on Mars.  He watches the news, reports of terrorist attacks, and reassurances of the government that everything is under control.  He dreams of walking the red soil with a woman who is not his wife.  Then, he hears about the company Rekall and their promise to deliver memories on demand, and takes advantage of their "special agent" package that will give him true to life memories of having been a secret agent on Mars, attached to a woman just like the one in his dreams.  The hijinks that ensue, when he apparently finds out that he really IS a secret agent from Mars, whose memories had been erased, are lots of fun.  What elevates the film above similar features like Running Man is that the action (which can get pretty violent) and adventure is tied to philosophical questions about the nature of memory and knowledge, and on the power of skepticism.<br /><br />You don't need to imagine high-tech corporations capable of implanting memories to realize that memory is a dubious source of knowledge.  We remember selectively at best, and psychological experiments have shown that memories can be altered and manipulated.  One of the basic questions the film poses is whether Quaid should trust his memory and instincts or his reason.  He needs to consider which is more likely: that he is a secret agent whose memories have been erased to make him seem like a lowly construction worker or whether the memory implant he actually remembers having chosen and that would make him remember to have been a secret agent with a sleazy brunette girlfriend has simply kicked in and is malfunctioning.  Reason favors the simplest explanation; but Quaid of course goes with his gut.  Does he choose correctly?<br /><br />The plot of the film, then centers around the basic philosophical question how can we know what we think we know.  It poses this question by means of a bizarre but entertaining science fiction scenario (drawn loosely from a story by Phillip K. Dick).  That the question is not merely academic for Paul Verhoeven, however, is suggested by how similar the news reports from Mars are to those that we hear (and were hearing even in 1990 when the film was released) from the middle East.  On Verhoeven's Mars, a group of rebels is fighting the governmental controls of society that are intended to secure its access to "Tribinium ore" -- a tremendous source of energy.  Because these rebels lack governmentally sanctioned legitimacy, their struggles to save their planet and way of life are labelled "terrorism."  The parallels are obvious.  The most significant brand of skepticism raised by this film is not the academic form that asks "how can I know whether I am not dreaming" but the very healthy and necessary political skepticism that asks "how far can we trust the media to present the facts about our world in an unbiased way?"'  While Quaid may well be mistaken in his belief that he is really  a secret agent, he is certainly right to be troubled about the distortions regarding the Middle East (um, Mars, that is) that are presented by the popular media.  As with most of the best of his films (Starship Troopers, Robocop, Black Book), Paul Verhoeven presents a powerful critique of contemporary society under the guise of a lightweight entertaining popcorn flick.  Definitely one to watch, both fun and enlightening.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Total Recall is set in the future after Mars has been colonized.  People are able to take "vacations" by having a type of brain implant placed in their heads. Alternate options are also available to help enhance one's "vacation".<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Doug Quaid, a working man who has trouble with reoccuring dreams about an event that happened on Mars, but he is unable to figure out what exactly happened.  Sharon Stone stars as Lori Quaid, Doug's beautiful but mysterious wife. Doug decides to visit ReKall, Inc., the company who specializes in the implanted vacations.  He chooses a visit to Mars as an undercover secret agent to confront the nemesis of his dreams; the evil Mars administrator played by Ronny Cox. Doug was somehow transformed by Cox and his associates, and he no longer has any memory of the events. Doug finds out more than he cares to, and he is left to find out who he really is.  Is he simply Doug, or is he someone else altogether?  <p>The plot of the movie is excellent and is loaded with top notch special effects.  The hologram scenes are especially well-done. This is a typical Schwarzenegger movie; a high body count and lots of good one-liners to keep everyone amused. Sci fi fans are sure to enjoy this fast paced thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>Comparing this new director approved transfer to the old artizan special edition dvd it is a huge step up in sharpness and a lot of scratches and flecks have been removed. However there are some digital artifacts that appear in the first 10 minutes (in particular over arnold head and face when he is having breakfast at home) that are very distracting. Thankfully they do not last. They were not on the artizan transfer at all and neither are they as prevelant on the dvd that comes with this blu ray release (which seems odd because it is the SD version of the new director approved transfer). Anyhow the rest of the film looks good, there are still some soft shots and some smearing here and there but it looks way better. The great commentary from the artizan release has been brought across as well as a new interview with Verhoeven and some making of featurettes.<br /> Dissappointing early scenes but well worth it overall.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I bought this cause I haven't seen it in a long time and it said it had a ton of special features.<br /><br />Well I am here to tell you that the special features are plentiful and they are very good.<br /><br />The thing that i was dissapointed about was the commentary.  It is the director and arnold talking, and they give you some very informative info on how arnold financed this movie, and how minority report was originally total recall two.  But arnold ends up ruining the commentary for me.  he keeps satimg "watch, watch this, I am a woman here and my head is about to explode, ok here it is".  This goes on for most of the commentary and is really annoying.  I was at least expecting it to be funny because it was so stupid, but arnold is just plain stupid.<br /><br />So overall a really good movie, good special features, and an ok commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>I could talk a lot about the stuff I like about "Total Recall" - the dynamite special effects, production design and action, the numerous Schwarzenegger one-liners ("Consider that a divorce" is my favorite), and the colorful supporting characters. And what's not to love about a movie that gives us midget hookers on Mars?<p>But that kind of stuff is de rigeur for "Ahnuld" films; what really sets this apart is clever, mind-bending premise that director Paul Verhoeven chooses never answers: was this all "real," or just an implanted memory? Was Schwarzenenegger's character, Doug Quaid, really a secret agent, or was this just an "ego trip," an implanted memory that looks and feels real?<p>There's an intriguing sequence about halfway through the movie in which Quaid is confronted by a doctor from Rekall, the company that sold Quaid his "secret agent on Mars" fantasy. The doctor, accompanied with his wife (Sharon Stone), tries to convince Quaid that his experiences aren't real at all, but part of the fantasy Rekall sold him; unless Quaid comes back to reality (by taking a pill), he'll end up a mindless zombie.<p>Of course, in Quaid's fantasy (or reality?), his wife has already tried to kill him, so he's not listening too closely to what she says. But for a moment, Quaid is buying what the doctor has to say...until he sees him sweating, and shoots him in the head. The logic, of course, is that if the doctor is make-believe, he wouldn't be under enough stress to sweat. However, who's to say that's not part of the fantasy?<p>A movie with less intelligence would have answered these sorts of questions, and given the audience a pat "wrap up" sequence to tie up all the loose ends. But give tons of credit to "Total Recall": in the best sci-fi tradition, it's up to the audience to figure it out what really happened.<p>Along the way, we're treated to a spectacular vision of a future Mars, populated by human colonists and mutants (including a three-breasted prostitute who'd probably make a fortune in Las Vegas). There's a red-light district ("Venusville"), which is apparently to the future what Amsterdam or Bangkok are to today's tourists: a sex destination. You can get a "Mars Today" newspaper, or check into the Hilton.<p>Verhoeven is a master of these movies, in which the future isn't quite "Blade Runner," but fairly well warped. Things we take for granted today, like commercials, mass transit, or vacations, still exist, even though they've morphed slightly. This is a world we can all recognize and relate to. <p>Of course, all is not well on Mars, as the planet's governor, Cohagen (Ronnie Cox) is charging the good citizens of the planet too much for air, and is trying to quell a rebellion. Quaid goes to Mars thinking he might have fought alongside the rebels against Cohagen, but finds out that he might have actually been working for Cohagen all along.<p>Before too long, Quaid discovers Cohagen's secret: there's a huge, alien-built machine that will melt massive underground ice deposits, and create a breathable atmosphere on Mars. If Mars has an atmosphere, Cohagen loses his power over the people - their air supply. <p>How does Quaid learn all this? He encounters a mutant who pops out of a seemingly normal person's belly, reads Quaid's thoughts, and shows him the truth. Of course, this is after we meet the three-breasted prostitute, so by this point, we're not surprised.<p>The wind-up, in which Quaid gives Mars its' atmosphere, is about as fanciful as you'd please - one wonders exactly how the oxygen content on the planet become sufficient in five minutes - but it ties into the whole "is it real or is it a fantasy" premise.<p>After all, the name of the fantasy Quaid selects at Rekall is "Blue Sky On Mars."<p>Is it for real, or is Quaid sitting in a machine imagining all this, and having his brain warped as the doctor said?<p>You decide. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoven's sci fi thriller Total Recall is one of his best films and also one of his most unashamedly ultra-violent. Verhoven's penchant for violence, strong female charcters and the obligatory nudity are all present and correct. In what would be one of Schwarzenegger's last good action films of late, the big man goes to Mars on a mission. Or does he? And this is what raises the film above standard sci fi fare, the 'is he or isn't he?' twists are clever and make the viewer actually use his/her brain! Shocker!  <p>Plot twists aside, the gore-factor sometimes goes too far, making this a very uneasy watch, and the film does tend to get formulaic at the ending. But it's Verhoven firing off all cylinders here with amazing action, astounding landscapes on Mars, some great one-liners, impressive FX and Arnie pulling a golf ball- sized tracking device out his nose! What more could you want? Extras, you say? Well this DVD has plenty for all the devotees, including a commentary from crazy Verhoven and Arnie going back and forth, 'making of's and tons of production material. A great movie, an equally great disc.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>Ah, long ago there was a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't concerned with making socially relevant films ... his mainstay was the science fiction / fantasy / action genre.  When he was at the height of the form, he had no rival, and TOTAL RECALL stands as a testament to his greatness.<p>With top notch special effects along with a story inspired by the master Philip K. Dick, Arnold proved that not had there been life on Mars long ago but life today was possible for humans with the right combination of scientific events.<p>Along for the ride were a youthfully sexy vixen named Sharon Stone, an equally sexy rival in Rachel Tinochen, a wonderfully evil villain in Ronny Cox, and genre fav Michael Ironside chewed scenery as well as Arnie did.<p>The commentary track adds some depth into the preproduction, filming, and postproduction process -- with a healthy amount of anecdotes thrown in for the average viewer -- making this Special Limited Edition (a tin in the shape of Mars, nonetheless) worth the view.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>It may be hard to believe if you weren't alive at the time, but 22 years ago -- before soulless remakes were a dime a dozen and blatant CGI cheapened blockbuster flicks -- Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled the world. Produced at the cusp of his pinnacle, "Total Recall" teamed the future-Governator with "Robocop" director Paul Verhoeven, proving to be a match made in heaven as the two forged absolute cinematic gold. Boasting a witty script based on a Philip K. Dick short, mind-boggling special effects and a relentless stream of humor and ultraviolence, "Total Recall" still makes for a fun ride after all of these years.<br /><br />Set in the year 2084, our story revolves around a simple blue-collar worker, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), who can't help but dream of the amber landscape of Mars. Even as his beautiful wife (a pre-"Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone) lies next to him at night, he's off in outerspace fantasizing about a life in another world with another woman (Rachel Ticotin). Against advice from his friends, he embarks on a fantasy vacation to Mars that promises an implanted memory of interplanetary espionage and extramarital lust without all the fuss of space travel and infidelity. As you can imagine, he gets more than he bargained for when something goes horribly wrong in the process and he actually finds himself on Mars, being hunted down whilst trying to, in his words, "give da people da air!"<br /><br />"Total Recall" is nothing if not entertainment taken to the extreme. Without all of the social commentary baggage of "Robocop," Verhoeven is free to let his love for over-the-top action and jarring violence spill all over the place. From the opening scene to the opening credits, the film is a relentless rollercoaster ride. At the helm, of course, is Arnold Schwarzenegger who runs amuck through the scenery, spouting off just as many one-liners as he does bullets. Though perfectly able actors such as Richard Dreyfuss and Jeff Bridges were originally in the running for the role, it's hard to imagine the film with anyone but Arnold as Quaid. A good 50% of the film's charm is thanks in part to his performance.<br /><br />Of course, one would be remiss if they didn't mention the absolutely stunning visual effects on hand. Thanks to legendary (but sadly MIA as of this writing) special effects guru Rob Bottin, there are sights in the film you aren't soon to forget, such as Arnold yanking a golf-ball sized tracking unit out of his nose and a female Martian who is, shall we say, well-equipped. Truly a time capsule of a bygone era, "Total Recall" pre-dates the CGI revolution brought on in later years by the likes of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Jurassic Park" and yet looks every bit as stunning today as it did when it was first released. The phrase "they don't make `em like they used to" definitely applies here.<br /><br />To put it simply, "Total Recall" is the last of its kind. It's hardly dated (aside from some bad fashion choices here and there) and its entertainment value has not waned one bit over the years. In this film, you have a truly iconic action star in his prime with a director at the top of his game, making for a true, blue action classic. Sure, it doesn't probe the depths of the psyche as much as it could, but there's so much going for it, it's easy to forgive the film its few shortcomings. Put simply, "Total Recall" is a film you'll likely recall for years to come.</p></br></body></html>
