Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the young girl who gets into the movie business as she and Gene Kelly's character develop romantic feelings for each other. As for the musical numbers, I couldn't take my eyes off them! These numbers must be some of the very best ever recorded on film. The movie was not filmed in widescreen but it didn't have to be-this film is all THAT good. The choreography, cinematography and overall design enhance this masterpiece and the musical score works perfectly, too.<br /><br />The film starts with an acting team from the silent era of motion pictures, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) showing up for the Hollywood premiere of "The Young Rascal;" it's yet another one of their silent films that makes the crowds gasp in awe. Their movies studio, Monumental Pictures) tells the public that they're in love for publicity; and even Lina believes it although Don knows it's not true! Don's pal and colleague, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is also there but Don, ever the ham, takes the microphone and the spotlight and indulges in some fantasy when asked about their past in the world of entertainment. All this happens while Lina remains completely silent--and actually, she's quiet for good reason, too--her voice is actually this screeching, high pitched, nails down a chalkboard experience that is better left unheard; and so Monumental Pictures' chief R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) lets Don do all the talking at public appearances.<br /><br />Things change fast, though, when their latest film being produced, "The Dueling Cavalier," must be changed into a "talkie." They all bemoan Warner Brothers' success with "The Jazz Singer;" and they wonder how on Earth they'll ever get around the fact that Lina's voice is terrible to listen to even if she is beautiful. However, it's not hopeless: Don, Cosmo and Kathy Selden (a young aspiring actress) devise a plan to make "The Dueling Cavalier" into a musical which will be renamed "The Dancing Cavalier." Moreover, they have another plan which is to dub Kathy's great voice for Lina's--but without Lina knowing it so she won't be tempted to have Kathy fired.<br /><br />Things can go pretty much in several different directions from here; and that of course is how everything eventually plays out--but I won't spoil it for you in case you don't know the rest of the plot yet! Suffice it to say that you'll be very entertained with numbers like Donald O'Connor's "Make `Em Laugh" and "The Broadway Melody." Look also for Cyd Charisse dancing with Gene Kelly and a young Rita Moreno plays Zelda Zanders as the movie playfully pokes fun at Clara Bow, the "It Girl."<br /><br />The two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. There's an optional running commentary with Debbie Reynolds and others; and the second DVD has two superlative documentaries, "Musicals Glorious Musicals" about what was called "The Arthur Freed Unit" at MGM and "What a Glorious Feeling" about the making of "Singing in the Rain." We also get clips of musical numbers from "Singing in the Rain" as they originally appeared in previous films.<br /><br />"Singing in the Rain" is clearly one of the best musicals ever produced; it's a must-have for any fan of musicals. Even people who don't like musicals will be humming along with the music! Fans of the actors will also want this for their collections.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've always made an exception for this one. Fred Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a Hollywood song-and-dance man who comes to New York to star in a Broadway flop. Cyd Charise agrees to be his dancing partner. Neither thinks the other wants him/her in the show, so they don't get along very well - at first. Not only does Astaire get the show on the right track, he makes things right between him and Charise. They also dance fantastically together. Jack Buchanan is brilliant in a minor role. The great music by Comden and Green, with marvelous songs by Dietz and Schwartz, are what make the movie exceptional: BY MYSELF, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, DANCING IN THE DARK, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE MY PLANS, TRIPLETS, I LOVE LOUISA, and, best of all, A SHINE ON YOUR SHOES all became standards in the Great American Songbook. The movie is a great earful as well as an eyeful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>One of the greatest movie musicals of all time, is also an affectionate spoof of show business and a very enjoyable old fashioned romantic comedy. It's got a greatest hits of Freed/Brown songs throughout (with the almost plageristic Make<br />'Em Laugh turned into a classic with Donald O'Connor's tour de force performance). Kelly's great but O'Connor and Hagen are even better and then there's Cyd Charisse. c. The color, choreography, performances, pacing, were all as good as some real masters of musical film (Donen/Kelly/MGM) could do in 1952. <p>The DVD is probably as good as it possibly could be for 2002 in terms of restoration, image and sound presentation.<p>The extras are more than generous with newly recorded commentaries from several surviving contributors to the film, a 35 minute love-fest of a new documentary letting you see how those still with us look today.<p>There is also the 90 minute PBS doc from a few years back that is a keeper featuring some archive footage, out-takes and more.<p>And yes there's more !!!<p>A classic treat. What are you waiting for?<p>----Christopher J. Jarmick is the author of the mystery suspense thriller, The Glass Cocoon (with Serena F. Holder).</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Singin' in the Rain is considered one of the greatest films of all time and I can definitely see why.  No, it's not an intellectual deep thinking man's movie.  No it isn't one known for the breathtaking camera angles and visuals, and no it doesn't have a plot that's so rich that you're bound to lose focuse halfway through.  It has heart, and that makes up for it.<br /><br />It's one of the most perfectly executed, and brilliantly scripted movies of all time.  It's fun, exciting, and the perfect family movie.  It doesn't try to be something it's not.  I could go on and on about what makes this movie great but I'm going to stop and actually spend some time reviewing the movie.<br /><br />As silent films are fading and being replaced by talkies (films with sound) two silent actors struggle to find their way in the ever chaging world of Hollywood.  Without going too deep into the plot I do have to say that this movie is one that people may see as overrated simply because every magazine or poll ranks it in the Top 10 greatest list.  Coupled with the fact that 70% of fans love it I don't see how it's overrated.<br /><br />The DVD is a definite must have.  A commentary featuring every person who was alive at that time that worked on the movie.  PLenty of featurettes and even an outtake from the film.  This is a definite must have.<br /><br />Definitely Must Have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>There's a reason this movie has earned so many accolades in the industry. It's a very tongue in cheek view of how the movie industry converted over from silent pictures to talking films. In this story, a romantic on-screen couple - played by Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen - have made many successful films together. Unfortunately for her, she has a high, squeaking Brooklyn accent that does not go with her glamorous movie image. When the studio tries to put together its first talking picture, the preview results involve laughter in the aisles.<br /><br />Gene decides to bring in his less known girlfriend, played by Debbie Reynolds, to dub in the singing and talking. In between the plot, you get a variety of musical numbers - from the classic dancing-in-the-street song done by Gene Kelly (with a fever of 103) - to numerous other romantic numbers, show numbers, comedy numbers and more.<br /><br />A true test for any movie is if it's enjoyable many years later. That's true with this movie, with a caveat. Many of the movie's scenes and costumes are deliberately making fun of other earlier Gene Kelly movies. The silent film is from his actual Three Musketeers footage, and there are many other in-jokes. If you watched this back in 1952, having grown up watching all of the other movies, all of the jokes would have been hilarious and immediately recognizeable. It would be like, in modern times, watching 'Scary Movie' and understanding all the references and jokes about other movies. However, in current times, few people have watched all of the Gene Kelly and other period movies in a row. So while we enjoy the movie's obvious charms, we miss a lot of those hidden messages.<br /><br />Still, there's a ton to enjoy in here even for first timers. The skill of the dancers is quite apparent, and the costumes are great, too. There are many dialogue bits which are laugh out loud funny. And, in a time when many movies are completely inappropriate for kids, this one is family-friendly through and through.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>This enchanting film is one I look forward to watching with my children , when they arrive , that is .<br /><br />As musicals are almost an extinct format nowadays , we can all enjoy this incredibly funny film for simply that , together with the humor that comes naturally out of the story itself .<br /><br />This film is for all future generations to enjoy again and again on DVD<br /><br />- we are likely to watch these films at home after all , as sadly they don't get shown at the multiplexes !</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>"Singin' in the Rain" is the crown jewel of the MGM musicals made between 1928 and 1960.  This is not a knock on the wonderful films that Fred Astaire made at MGM and other studio's, not at all, but without a doubt this one is the best synthesis of Broadway Musical and Hollywood extravaganza.  Made in stunning color just in time to keep audiences away from the first wave of TV sets, Hollywood had Gene Kelly tapping down everything he knew about dance into a fun little script about the old transition from 1920's flappers and silents to the new audio age.<br /><br />It is so much fun to see the contrast between Donald O'Connor, the limber clown, and Gene Kelly the athletic man's man. Their dance is all about thrills and acrobatics, spectacular steps and synchronization.  Add young Debbie Reynolds, and the effect is pure entertainment.  Get up off your couch and start dancing on the dining room table.  Don't scare the wife and kids.<br /><br />Much has been said about the sexy Cyd Charisse number.  Her long, long, green stocking legs made the boys uncomfortable in their theatre seats.  I think she was taller than Gene Kelly.  The Freudian, gauze in the wind scene is all about intercourse as much as the sensibilities of 1952 could handle.  It's burlesque, but ballet, or modern dance, combining at a time when Broadway was experimenting; Bob Fosse and others were choreographing the golden age of American stage musical.<br /><br />In the end, sentimental, romantic, and ageless, SITR is in the top twenty films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Despite the fact it's a musical, SITR is one of the most watchable films ever made. The acting is great, ditto the camerawork, and there are just enough musical numbers; not too many that they get in the way of the plot (which is superb, BTW... funny as hell in some spots), and none that are too overblown. This was easily both the absolute height of Reynolds' and O'Connor's careers ("Make'Em Laugh" is a masterpiece), and one of Kelly's  very finest moments as well. And don't forget Cyd Charisse in that green outfit!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>[Review of the single disc edition, rented from Netflix.  The DVD had commentary by Liza Minelli and a few trailers from some of Fred Astaire's great films.  There's a scene selector but not much more than that.  No real special features or "making of" that usually make these DVDs fun to pore through.  Still, a fun film that you don't want to miss.  Broadway musicals are not filmed much anymore, staying with stage presentations.  In Fred's day, they filmed them as well to large, responsive audiences.]<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />This was a fairly impressive film.  If you really like musicals and lots of schmaltzy dialogue, this may be for you.  For me I felt the storyline a bit too much and way too many musical numbers for me, but that's just me.<br /><br />Fred plays Tony, a washed up song & dance man who tries to make a comeback.  He hooks up with some friends who are scriptwriters, but unfortunately they deal with a prima donna director who changes it all and is so demanding and so annoying that Tony walks out.<br /><br />The other star is Cyd Charrisse, whose elegant ballet legs and sexy demeanor really make the film for me.  Too bad that the films of the day dubbed in other singers when she opens her mouth.  Was her singing really that bad?<br /><br />There are some scenes where the dubbing is off.  The director is not moving his lips yet you hear "Tremendous, stupendous...etc."<br /><br />Memorable Moments:  When Fred and Cyd dance.  She does not have the staccato style of tap that I have seen with Fred and Powell and she does not have that smooth sexy elegance of Ginger Rogers.  What she does have is an athletic ability and choreography with Fred to make it happen.  For me, there just was not enough emotional chemistry during the dancing.  "Dancing in the Dark" was my favorite of the numbers.<br /><br />Plot, Etc.:<br /><br />"Bandwagon" is the name of the Broadway play and when they change it to what they really want it to be, the play becomes a hit.  Most of the film shows scenes from the play that are really excuses to show off the singing and dancing.  Great work, you can really see the actors enjoying themselves.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Though somewhat schmaltzy, "Bandwagon" is worth a watch for Fred and Cyd, as well as the big hit of the day, "That's Entertainment!"  Nowadays, you get these musicals straight from the Broadway stage.  In the 50s, the film versions were top notch.

There's references here to dozens of familiar tunes written by these talented men back in the 1920s and '30s.<br /><br />Kudos to Jean Hagen, who is simply remarkable as the always repulsive, forever screechy Lina Lamont. The character is based on Norma and Constance Talmadge-- Their star-rank careers came to a sudden end with the advent of talkies because both had heavy Brooklyn accents and unpleasant voices.<br /><br />A description here of the movie's most famous sequence, "Broadway Melody."<br /><br />In this extended number, the new-to-New York Gene Kelly enters briskly from stage left. He wears a straw hat, striped jacket and black frame glasses and carries a valise as he gaily calls out the opening phrase, "Gotta dance!" Kelly is then ushered into a fast-paced NY world. He quickly rises from burlesque clown to baggy pants vaudevillian to a tuxedoed gent in the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Kelly becomes infatuated with the beautiful girlfriend of a gangster (Cyd Charisse in a stunning green gown) and the two perform an elegant fantasy ballet. From here it's all downhill. The small town boy ends up as he started: on the street. Although now clad in a fine suit of evening clothes, the enthusiasm is gone-- he looks mournful.<br /><br />At that moment, another new arrival strides rapidly from stage left. He's dressed just as Gene was when he came to Broadway and he sings out the same "Gotta dance!" Gene's spirits revive. He happily calls back and the production ends on a high note.<br /><br />The entire story is most entertaining and like all great films, it holds up well. The above sequence is nothing less than stunning and if you've never seen it before, you are in for the rarest of treats.

A previous reviewer put it quite well when he said that while the movie makes fun of the silent film era, it also shows a respectful nostalgia towards it.<br /><br />Gene Kelly seems to have made an art out of covering his coincidental rise to fame with a single word: "Dignity." Gene Kelly works with Lena who is beautiful enough for silent films. But her unrefined voice makes us aware that she will have a problem if movies go to sound.<br /><br />Gene Kelly later runs into Debby Reynolds. Their first meeting ends in a hilarious argument. If we know romances, we can sense that they will end up together. They later meet, and Kelly realizes that Reynolds is 'not so far above him.' But he is moved with compassion. (Perhaps due to his difficult past, he sees a parallel.)<br /><br />Later, we see that movies are going to sound. While this presents difficulties to all, Lena will have the most problems if she wants to keep her job. The only weak link here is that I don't like how Lena is often made the object of scorn. (All she really wants is to keep her job.) She's no saint to be sure, but is she really so bad for wanting to keep her job?<br /><br />Moving on, reynolds and Kelly meet again, and they begin working on a project together. We can see that the transition from silent films to talking films was not so easy. An especially hilarious moment is the miserable failure of the screen test (topped off by the sound going out of timing).<br /><br />But Reynolds and Kelly (former enemies) work together and find a way to save the movie. One thing that makes this movie so great is the harmonious mixture of speaking parts, singing, and dancing.<br /><br />One comical character worth mentioning is R.F. He gets a tad hypocritical: "Trust me, talking pictures will never amount to anything. They'll lose their shirts." Later, he says: "I told you talking pictures were a menace, but no one would listen."<br /><br />In many ways, this film is a great treasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too - and the extras package on the two-disc set is particularly impressive: a deleted musical number Two Faced Woman and unused dailies, documentaries about the making of the film and Vincente Minnelli (with daughter Liza and Michael Feinstein providing an audio commentary on the feature), a musical short Jack Buchanan with the Glee Quartet, and a slew of Astaire trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GN9I0UYV08LC.html">A3GN9I0UYV08LC</a><br/><p>Silent Movie are giving in to talking pictures - and a hoofer.turned-matinee idol (Gene Kelly 1912-1996) is caugh in that bumpy transition , as well his buddy (Donald O'Connor 1925-2003), Prospective ladylover (Debbie Reynold 1932 - ) and shrewish co-star (Jean Hagen 1923-1977) .

It focuses on movies making the transition from the silent to the sound era. Stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagan) plan to make The Dueling Cavalier as a silent film until sound revolutionizes the industry. It is created as a sound film, but they have much more trouble with the new technology than they imagined, not to mention the fact that the leading lady has a horribly inappropriate voice for her looks and for the part. The movie is saved when Lockwood's girlfriend Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) agrees to dub the part, helping to turn it into a musical. With the help of their wisecracking friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), they serve to make the film a hit.<br /><br />All of the actors have their charms in this film, even the annoyingly vocalized character Lamont. O'Connor is funny and exuberant throughout the film, Kelly is charming and mischievious, and Reynolds is incredibly sweet.<br /><br />The only drawback is the long "Gotta Dance" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Although it demonstrates the ability to tell stories without dialogue and the power of dance, it tends to lose the audience for a moment. Some will enjoy it, but it takes the audience out of the film for quite a while for seemingly no reason. The rest of the music is great; most of it has been taken from other films from past eras (think Moulin Rogue) and incorperated into the story. The flapper era is captured more glamorously than it truly was, but it adds to the charm of the film. The film relies on stereotypes of silent films, but it also thrills film buffs with the references to classic movies. This film has something for everyone which makes it truly one of the great films of American cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>An obvious choice, but hard to resist what is likely the best film musical of all time. The period music is delightful, and the dancing routines sensational.

Must-viewing for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Singin' in the Rain is definately one of my favorite musical films of all time.  No movie has ever gone into the Hollywood atmosphere to show how movies were made.  All the acting is superb.  Gene Kelly in this film is truely his best performance, as well as the laugh out loud Donald O' Connor.  Debbie Reynolds also plays a sweet innocent perfect character that she was born to play.  The music is fast paced and addictive, and unlike some musicals never slows down the pace of the plot line.  This is a definate film to see in your lifetime.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.)  Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall.  The solution?  Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals.  The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.<p>In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early &quot;all talking, all dancing, all singing&quot; movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.  The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers.  The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm.  As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an engergy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.<p>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love.  Whether or not you consider it &quot;the&quot; finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ.  But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This movie begins with a phenomenal if misleading shot.  It shows a top hat and cane belonging to former dancing legend Tony Hunter being auctioned, with no takers.  Of course, if you see a top hat and cane, you think "Fred Astaire."  But despite the implication and reference, Fred Astaire was, at the time this film was being made, still very much the greatest dancer in the movies (with apologies to Gene Kelly).  Unlike Tony Hunter, he had never ceased to make "A" pictures.  But no one could have played this role with more authority than Astaire.  <p>The plot is simple:  washed-out and used-up former dance legend Tony Hunter is returning to Broadway in an attempt to revive his sagging career.  That provides the pretext that is needed for a nearly perfect musical.  THE BAND WAGON is a magnificent blend of great songs, great music, great dancer numbers, great actors, and great comedy.  The cast is perfect.  You get not only the greatest song and dance man in movie history but also a magnificent partner in the elegant and leggy Cyd Charise.  You get great comic relief with Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray.  And you get one of the few musical comedy performers who could rival Fred Astaire for elegance and charm in Jack Buchanan.<p>The musical numbers are both marvelous and apparently never ending.  The film begins with Fred performing "By Myself" and then soon shifts to a thoroughly rousing version of "Shine on My Shoes."  Later in the film, two enormously debonair song and dance men (Fred and Jack) perform "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan's."  And that doesn't even come close to exhausting the list.  <p>Perhaps the highpoint of the film, however, comes when Tony and Gabrielle, the ballet performer the producers want to partner him with, uncertain that they will be able to dance with each other at all, take a carriage ride through Central Park to try to get to know each other.  As they drive, they come upon an outdoor dance floor, with an orchestra playing the haunting Dietz and Schwartz classic "Dancing in the Dark" (which lyricist Dietz intended to be a meditation about the nature of human existence; Schwartz's music matched the mood of the lyrics perfectly).  Tony and Gabrielle get out and begin to walk together in rhythm, gradually and tentatively attempting a few dance steps.  Eventually, they discover each other's rhythm, and they begin to dance together marvelously and magnificently, matching the mood of the music precisely.  It is one of the greatest moments in either Astaire or Charisse's career.  <p>This is a must see film for any fan of the movie musical.  I have to confess that I am not, by and large, a big fan of the MGM musical.  I prefer the kookiness of the older RKO musicals, or even the stylized musicals of Warners or even Fox.  MGM musicals were, to me, too often overproduced and dominated by the art directors.  This film, however, is a magnificent exception.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>This is one of several DVD sets that TCM/WHV is producing over the next year or so that brings the classic films to the masses at affordable prices. All of these films are available in more deluxe editions, so this is mainly for those who are not interested in extra features. Every one of these is a five star film for musical lovers.<br /><br />Singin in the Rain is my favorite movie musical and perhaps the best movie musical ever made. Thrown together quickly after the success of "An American in Paris" I love it for its comedy, its timing, and its wonderful plag iarism of just about every song written for MGM movies between 1929 and 1940. If you are interested in extras this film is available as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006DEF9">Singin' in the Rain (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. The two disc edition has some wonderful extras about the transition from silent film to sound.<br /><br />The Band Wagon is one of Fred Astaire's best MGM musicals. Fred plays an aging song and dance man whose friends are writing a new Broadway show and want Fred to star. They enlist a Broadway headliner to help them get financial backing, but the show the veteran describes is a musical version of Faust, not the fun romp that was originally planned. This one is available in a more deluxe version as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YXPKQ">The Band Wagon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.<br /><br />The Easter Parade stars Fred Astaire again. After being rejected by his girlfriend/star, on a lark he offers Judy Garland a job as his partner, claiming he could make her as big a star as his ex-girlfriend. The next day he regrets his offer, but he has to go through with it when Judy shows up for rehearsal after having already quit her current job. Again, if you like extra features it is available as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007939MU">Easter Parade (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Meet Me in St. Louis stars Judy Garland and is about - absolutely nothing. However, this musical which has no big events and no real dramatic climax will grow on you. It is about a year in the life of an extended St. Louis family. The father has accepted a job offer in New York City, and nobody in the family is happy about it. This midwestern group does not want to give up their easy-going way of life and all of their friends for the big treeless city. Worse yet, the move is scheduled to take place at Christmas. This is available in the deluxe <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKGZ">Meet Me In St. Louis (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. The best thing about this 2-disc edition is the inclusion of the 1930 Vitaphone short "Bubbles". Besides being one of the strangest little musical shorts ever, it stars Judy Garland back when she was still one of the Gumm Sisters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D.html">A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies ever made.  With a talented cast consisting of Gene Kelley, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor you can't go wrong.  There are so many unforgettable scenes in this movie that no one could ever touch.  Gene Kelley singing and dancing his way thru the neighborhood to Singin in the Rain, and all three companionably working their magic to Good Mornin.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>First off, I need to point out that Amazon does have this odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of  ALL versions and editions of a film in one place. So when a film is restored or reissued the reviews are grouped with the others. There are over400 reviews for "Singing in the Rain" here and they stretch back as far as 1998 and as recent as July 2012. Reviews are automatically sorted by the "Most Helpful" first and - while I hope you will find my review helpful - I do encourage you to look at the date of any review you read and compare it with the "release date" of the edition you are looking to purchase. With that said, I'll move on to my review.<br /><br />I'll go along nearly everyone who treasures "Singin in the Rain" in saying it is probably one of the most important films ever made and the top musical. It's also the most entertaining 103 minutes you'll se on the screen. Sure there is smart dialogue, but the film boasts a compendium of wonderful "hit songs" that were all succeses even before the were incorporated in the story by Comden & Green. Go ahead and read the other reviews, if you are not familier with the plot or background of the film. That hasn't changed in the 20+ years of reviews.<br /><br />I last reviewed this film on DVD 10 years ago when Warner Home Video released the 50th anniversary package in 2002. That was before Blu-ray. Because the multi-disc versions of the new 60th Anniversary Edition contain all the "special features" of the 50th Anniversary one, I chose the single-disc Bluray to see the new HD transfer and the new 53-minute documentary. The single-disc BD contains only the HD transfer, the doc, a "juke-box" function and the Theatrical Trailer (along with the commentary track from the 50th).<br /><br />The PRINT is glorious even on my non HD TV. And the film was not in Wide Screen so the dimensions of your screen don't matter. The documentary really didn't add much, but was fun to watch. Its purpose was to reach the younger generation who are fans of "Glee" and "High School Musical". Both choreographers and actors from those shows are interviewed and tell about the first time they saw the film. A few "oldsters" like Rob Marshall and Baz Luhrman add comments and there are some from film historian Rudy Behlmer (who appeared on the Warner musical reissues before the start of the press-on-demand Warner Archive series). Of course there are lots of clips from the film (some repeated again and again) as well as clips from other Kelly films as well as Fred Astaire films - comparing the two. A brief mention of importance of Arthur Freed is made but no discussion of the new digital transfer. It's an OK doc but, not sure it breaks any new ground.<br /><br />Still, if you love this film (and I can watch it over and over) and have an HD TV, you'll probably want to pick this up. If you have the prior edition and an HD TV you'll want the single disc BD. If you don't own the prior one, you'll want the 2-disc version for all the extra bonus that were added 10 years ago.<br /><br />But this is a DVD (in one form or another) that EVERYONE should own.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>This stunning new 2-disc edition of THE BAND WAGON - in my opinion the greatest musical ever made at MGM - is a must for all classic movie fans.  The story is simple and effective.  Washed-up Hollywood hoofer Tony Hunter (Fred Astaire) goes to try his luck on the Broadway stage, in a musical written by husband-and-wife team Lester and Lily Marton (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray).  Bombastic `renaissance man' Jeffrey Kordova (Jack Buchanan) is assigned to direct and the simple sunny musical written by the Martons' is transformed into a moralistic Faustian tale.  Tony is frustrated-still by his leading lady, elegant ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse).  Will the show come together?  Will Tony and Gaby ever get along?  Find and join the joyous BAND WAGON!<br /><br />The film looks glorious in an all-new `Ultra Resolution' restorative transfer.  The colours fairly pop off the screen.  The sound is presented in a newly-mastered 5.1 mix (though the original mono track is also available for purists).  Extras include a delightful audio commentary where old pals Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein have a grand  time (Minnelli talks about her father's experiences directing the picture and she shares her memories of visiting the set as a wide-eyed 6-year-old).  There's also a new Making-Of featurette, with new interviews of  Nanette Fabray, Cyd Charisse, James Mitchell and Ava Astaire McKenzie, Fred's daughter.  The cut number "Two-Faced Woman" is presented both in it's full length and in dailies (I still have no idea why this fabulous number was cut, it's a perfect example of Minnelli's style coupled with the smouldering sensuality that Cyd Charisse was perfect at conveying).  There is also silent footage of some other cut scenes (including where "Two-Faced Woman" would have sat in the picture).  There's also the vintage TV episode of "The Men Who Made the Movies" that focused on Vincente Minnelli (copious amounts of great footage from his musicals) and a rare Vitaphone short featuring a very young Jack Buchanan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VUO1LJGMSZQY.html">A3VUO1LJGMSZQY</a><br/><p>Curious that this '02 DVD set is 'OOP', and so new fans now have to purchase in blu to get a new copy at reasonable price. What is wrong with this picture, wherein a truly classic film can ONLY be sold (or even watched) via the latest/greatest technology? I doubt that the film looked as good in 1953 as it does on even this '02 edition (which was "Digital transfer from state-of-art-restored elements"). But hey, I'm an old guy, one that prefers the classics, but one who also -ashamedly- has occasionally bought into the "must have THIS version" hype (incl. Patton,Apoc Now,All Quiet,Zhivago,Taxi Driver, WWonka, etc.), often giving away perfectly good 'old' dvd copies to those who have never seen 1st time. I suppose for purpose of selling an old product to a new crowd (hence the modern new artwork, ick!), this is a good thing, but I for one will continue to enjoy my TEN YEAR OLD (!) dvd copy, with it's lovely packaging and slew of extras (majority of which are absent from single blu, but available in $$$ boxset). It may not be HD, but it wasn't in '53 either, and this dvd still looks great (THERE'S my review, for those who've endured my rant to the end!).<br /> ...and a quick update: re-visited first 10 min. of dvd. WOW! Has got to be one of the best film intros EVER: the writing (incl. terrific dry wit), the acting, the dancing, the overall montage, the set-up to the rest of story. Perfect on all counts. Really enjoy the recreation of silent movie production! DVD still looks 'glorious' on 1080p tv thru blu player. BUY THIS FILM, in whatever format (I noticed that a couple reviews down someone was glowing over their VHS copy. Good for them! Hooray for Hollywood!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Unlike many other movies that top various best of lists, I absolytley agree that Singin in the Rain deserves to be tops in many great musical lists.  There's something that makes Singin in the rain a magical experience, especially when it's stacked against the competition of musicals that threaten it's reputation.  Maybe musicals aren't my thing, but most songs are slow, drawn out, boring, and the same thing over and over again in most musicals.  Singin in the Rain is fast paced, sometimes implausable and plot hole-ridden (Who the hell conveices an idea like Cosmo and Don did to the RF?), but when your laughing at Lina's hideous vioce (I tend to go Mystery Science Theater 3000 and insult and answer her questions), feeling the rhythmic tap dancing, being hilarious entertained by the humor of it all, or just simple indulging in the movies extreme energy and charisma, who the ______ cares?  I sure don't, which is one reason why I enjoy this knockout movie quite the bit.<br /><br />MUSICAL NUMBERS (Music, dancing) 19/20<br /><br />There are only two things wrong with the music.  You Are My Lucky Star's great background music is utterly destroyed by the HORRIFYING lyrics, and You Were Meant For Me is saved by it's instrumental passage (the music is great beneath it, but the lyrics are pretty lame).  That's it.  Every other musical number is a knockout, and there is no filler of any kind.  Instrumentally, it recalls the glory days of those HOllywood numbers, as the background music is jazzy, upbeat, absolutely happy but never annoying or childish.  I also do love the score in the background as well, as it's also terrific.<br /><br />And as for the dancing, it's not the most brilliant or technically hard thing ever, but the performances never get old, with a lot of different styles besides tap.  Fred Astaire may have been graceful, but Gene Kelly had the energy.  Oh, and did you know he performed his famous number with a 103 degree fever?  Donald O' Conner follows suite, and this guy could even do a wall flip without wires.  Cyd Charisse's dancing is seductive and brilliant, and Debbie Reynolds, well, learned fast.  Everyone is a complete joy to watch, so let's just leave it at that.<br /><br />ART DIRECTION 10/10<br /><br />Keeping true to the fantasty Hollywood, I really can't help but love the look of this film.  They made great care to make the 20's Hollywood fully envisioned; Gene Kelly even looked at photographs at length to nail down the look.  I don't make a big deal about things such as costumes, but I think most of the costumes are great to look at.  Even if they aren't my taste (among then include the Dueling Cavalier costumes.  Somtimes things are better off being outdated), it still adds to the movie anyway.  Besides, it's what they wore back then, it's supposed to be depicing that time.  Even so, plenty of them look cool, so I guess it works.<br /><br />What I do love more is the architecture and interior design, which is much more my thing to look at.  I love all of the designs, and I also think the Broadway look was nailed as well, entirely painted like a dark room ride almost.  There's even some slick visual tricks in the midst, but that's really not the main focus of it.  It's just a great looking movie.<br /><br />CHARACTERS AND ACTING 18/20<br /><br />All the stars of the movie bring prescene, and as a consequence, the actors and actresses that play their perspective parts will never leave my mind.  For now one, Gene Kelly will always be Don Lockwood, and every other part will be Gene Kelly as "(insert role here)".  He's a great dancer and did much more than this, but this is the most memorable part he has ever done.  It goes for everybody else as well.<br /><br />As for the chracters, they aren't typically unique, but all of them memorable.  Jean Hagen will always be known as the lady with the most grating voice of all kind, and it's generally a funny movie.  Cyd Charisse makes a great appearance as the seductive gangster's girlfriend in the Broadway section, and it's easily one of the most memorable regarding females, a sort of sleazy girl who a flair for being dangerous and attractive at the same time.  Needless to say, while you won't learn anything from these characters, you certainly will love them all.<br /><br />STORY AND DIALOGUE 18/20<br /><br />The Story is another thing that makes this movie highly enjoyable.  While tons musicals contain an overblown romantic story, Singin' In the Rain's love story (done with subtley, thank god) takes a back seat to themes about deception of words, and the fact that the movie is largely about the film industry itself.  As everybody knows, the movie offers a comedic take on the bumpy road from silents from talkies.  The ending may be a bit predictable, but who cares?  The way is filled with a great script, memorable moments, great songs, and art direction.  There's hardly a dull moment in the whole thing.<br /><br />The dialogue is generally funny and always great, and features great lines, dry humor, and observations about the silent film era, and the acting of the time.  This is a very quotable movie despite the fact you will probably look like an uncool twit (verses saying the latest line from the Judd Apatow involded comedy movies that everybody loves).  Either way, highly highly memorable.<br /><br />This movie is the kind of movie that makes my day better at times, almost so if I have had my Grande Latte Enema and it hasn't even worn out.  if people think I'm too happy or something, _____ em'.  Heh, jokes on them if they know me (do you tend to notice that once you get know people, you sometimes like them less and less as much as you like them more and more?).  Singin' In the Rain is one of the very few things that I love that are happy and heartwarming, unlike many, many other forms of media (*cough* Titanc *cough*)that make me feel absolutely nothing.  This is a gem of a movie, and while it isn't perfect, nothing quite comes close to it.  The Citizen Kane of musicals?  Maybe, only it's actually deserving of it's place on the polls.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Singin' in the Rain" is one of the all time great films.<br /><br />It stands as a monument to the talents of producer Arthur Freed, the MGM musical unit he ran, and above all the great Gene Kelly.<br /><br />Period songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown are brilliantly interwoven into a story of the coming of sound to Hollywood.<br /><br />The Studio system had its faults but it also allowed films such as this to be made - and we should all be grateful for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>I'm embarrassed to say that I had never even heard of this film musical until I encountered it on Roger Ebert's list of all-time greatest movies (I'm checking them out at the public library, and as this title suggests, I'm up to the B's as of this writing).<br /><br />Well, Ebert's correct as always.  This is a WONDERFUL musical, powered by the songs of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and a brilliant cast led by Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Nanette Fabray, and Oscar Levant.<br /><br />Impeccably directed by Vincente Minnelli, the movie tells the story of the making of a Broadway show, starring a famous star on a downward trajectory in his career (played by Astaire) and an ascendant ballet dancer (played by a gorgeous Charisse in her first acting role).<br /><br />Outstanding numbers here include the immortal "That's Entertainment," "Louisiana Hayride," and "Dancing in the Dark," although the scenes featuring lesser known tunes are showstoppers as well, including "A Shine on Your Shoes" and "Triplets," both of which must truly be seen to be believed.<br /><br />This double-disc DVD set merits special recognition as well, as the film has been beautifully restored to do justice to Minnelli's brilliant and meticulously selected color palette, and the second disc includes fascinating features on the making of the film and highlights of Minnelli's career.<br /><br />I must also make mention of one of the best film commentary tracks I've ever heard, featuring Great American Songbook scholar and singer Michael Feinstein and his good buddy, the one and only Liza Minnelli, who apparently got to visit the set every day and watch her dad shoot the film back in 1952.  Liza's in an exceptionally ebullient mood here, and both commentators avow that "The Band Wagon" is their all-time favorite film musical.<br /><br />Pick up this DVD set for your family, and you'll see why.  And if the reprise of "That's Entertainment" at the finale of the film doesn't leave you in tears of joy -- well, I wonder what could.  HIGHLY recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it.  Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, "Singin' In the Rain," directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released "The Jazz Singer," and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot.  There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a "falling" star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.  <p> Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for "On the Town" and "It's Always Fair Weather") certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital "E"-- and that's exactly what you get.  The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying:  Donald O'Connor's "Make `Em Laugh;" "Good Mornin'," which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with "Moses," who "Supposes his `toeses' are roses;" and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while "Singin' and dancin' in the rain."  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.<p> When Kelly sings "Gotta dance!" you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their "Moses" number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly.  Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.  <p> Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic "Make `Em Laugh" number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.<p> Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.<p> As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in "Radio Days," Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the "vain" out of "vanity," and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.<p> The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than "Singin' In the Rain," which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.  There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>And while I probably don't have anything particularly new to say about this, one of the 10 greatest films ever made in the history of motion pictures, I do none the less strongly urge any and all fans of great movies to add this celebration of life to your permanent film collection. Especially now with this crisp deluxe DVD transfer which gloriously captures the rich colors of director Stanley Donen's expert eye.<br /><br />I am not a great fan of musicals per se, but this film is something far more than a simple genre picture. It is a celebration of the creative muse.<br /><br />At the central core of the narrative is the very real lesson to be learned from acting teacher Constantine Stanislavski: "Love the Art in yourself, not yourself in the art." Kelley's "Don Lockwood", Donald O'Connor's "Cosmo Brown" and Debbie Reynolds' "Cathy Seldon" all succeed because of their undying will and love for very art of performing and creating. Comedic villain "Lina Lamont" as portrayed by the excellent Jean Hagen, is undone by her shallow devotion to her own celebrity.<br /><br />The film, besides being one of the most legitimately uplifting and entertaining experiences an audience can ever enjoy (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a far more effective anti-depressant than any prescription!), also is a historical accurate depiction of the drastic paradigm shift that occurred not only in film, but in acting history as well. The coming of sound brought drastic, and cataclysmic changes in acting technique. No longer could actors, like "Don" and "Lina" do what they always did- "Just add talking". While many folks do (and in many cases, rightfully so) believe that a large part of real acting died with the coming of sound, an entire new industry of Acting training resulted- hence the need for teachers like Stanislavski and others.<br /><br />In fact, this film has been an important part of my high school acting curriculum for several years. It is refreshing to see how big an influence this film has on all ages. Especially teenagers addicted to violent clap trap, big budget exploitation flicks and rap music.<br /><br />The New York vs. Los Angeles acting rivalry. The comical over enunciated vocalization, the purposefully "cheezy" recreated musical numbers ("Beautiful Girls" is classic!) and a very real depiction of how one built an acting career (barrooms to strip clubs to Burlesque to Vaudeville to Broadway to films) are all historical elements that lend the film depth and strength.<br /><br />Gene Kelley, perhaps even more than the great Astaire, was a great artist who combined a fierce alpha mail athleticism to his mastery of all dance styles. Here, he excels in telling stories through not only tap, but ballet and jazz as well. Debbie Reynolds was never better as the innocent yet strong willed ing&eacute;nue. She and Kelley (and along with Cyd Charrise) create a real sexual chemistry. Anyone who is not convinced that dance can not be a substitute for explicit sex needs to see the utter taste and class depicted here.<br /><br />Donald O'Connor steals the show with his rubber face and impeccable timing. O'Connor's dancing is impressive also- especially in the "Moses Supposes" number in which he matches Kelley step for step. His "Make 'Em Laugh" teaches Jim Carrey a thing or two about how to make broad physical comedy appealing and not obnoxious.<br /><br />Ultimately, like all great films and other works of literature, Singin' in the Rain holds up perfectly to repeated viewings. It is a fresh and vibrant the 100th time as it is the first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8GXSCB1R05T.html">A2B8GXSCB1R05T</a><br/><p>&quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; is a moment of pure joy captured on film.  I can never get over the look on Gene Kelly's face when he sings that classic line.  It make me smile along with him everytime.<p>This has got to be one of the happiest movies I have seen.  Not silly or funny or goofy (well, there is a little bit of that), but just plain happy.  Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds are excellent as three chums hatching a plan.  These three conspirators want to save the silent movie dud &quot;The Dueling Cavalier&quot; by changing it into a musical.  The roadblock to their success is the spoiled starlet, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen, nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this role) who's squeaky voice and lack of talent are set to tank the picture.<p>The plot, while fun, takes second place to the astounding musical numbers.  &quot;Good Morning, Good Mo-r-ning, We've talked the whole night though, Good Morning, Good Morning to you.&quot; (one of my favorites).  &quot;Make 'em Laugh&quot; does just that, with Donald O'Connor strutting his vaudeville stuff.  &quot;Broadway Melody&quot;  (also known as &quot;Gotta Dance&quot;) is a mesmerizing duet with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse .  That particular piece is studied in dance history courses and considered a major work of American dance.<p>But at the end, it all comes down to &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  What a wonderful thing, watching Gene Kelly splashing around in the puddles.  Happiness caught on film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>The Band Wagon is one of those excellent MGM musicals with enough song and dance musical numbers to make your eyes bug out! The color is excellent and the sound is good. The plot moves along at a good pace; and there was never a dull moment. The cinematography and the choreography work very well, especially in scenes where the actors are performing a play within a movie.<br /><br />The action begins when Tony Hunter (Fred Astaire), a washed up actor and dancer, comes to New York to try his luck on Broadway as well as meet his old friends Lily and Lester Martin (Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant, respectively). Lily and Lester are not just married--they're also a writing team! They hatch a plan to revive Tony's career with a great artistic vehicle for him. Tony agrees but soon there's a great deal of uneasiness for Tony when he discovers that Lily and Lester want the great star Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan), who also directs and produces, to plan out the show.<br /><br />Things become even more uneasy when Tony doesn't exactly hit it off with the female leading lady, Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse). Tony worries that Gabrielle might be taller than he is; and Tony and Gabrielle just don't get along. Worse yet, Jeffrey Cordova insists that the vehicle for Tony's comeback be transformed into a type of Faustian play that Tony comes to loathe.<br /><br />Of course, from here the plot could go just about anywhere. Will Tony and Gabrielle ever see eye-to-eye? What about Gabrielle's boyfriend who is the choreographer for the show--how will he fit into the picture? Will the changing of the show to a Faustian theme really work? How will Lily and Lester react to the changes being made to the show? No spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!<br /><br />Of course, you buy this for the movie; but the extras are extensive and very impressive. There's a great commentary by Liza Minnelli and you get a great documentary about Vincente Minnelli, the director of The Band Wagon. The Fred Astaire trailer gallery is nice but you'll probably be more amazed at a rare Vitaphone short featuring Jack Buchanan way before The Band Wagon was ever filmed!<br /><br />The Band Wagon is clearly one of the great MGM musicals. There are many timeless moments including the "That's Entertainment" number; and the sequence of musical numbers that wind up the film is wonderful to behold. I highly recommend this film for people who love classic movie musicals; and fans of the stars of this picture will almost surely want to get this for their collections.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Who doesn't know the words to the song `Singin' in the Rain'?  I mean, seriously, even if you have yet to see the movie I'm sure you could sing that song word for word right now.<br /><br />Go ahead; I'll wait.<br /><br />The thing is that I too had never seen this movie yet knew all those words and it made me question just why it was that I never sat down to watch this beloved musical.  I am not really a huge musical lover, but then again, I've never been one to disregard a movie because of genre before.  I'll watch anything at least once.  So, when this came on TCM a few months ago I just had to watch it.  I got everything ready for `movie night' (the drinks, the friends, the snacks) and I settled in to watch what has steadily been considered one of the top ten movies of all time.<br /><br />I loved it!<br /><br />Everything about this movie fits so perfectly into one another.  The music is divine, the performances are stellar, the set pieces are delicious and the script is fun, fresh and wholly entertaining.  There is not a single misstep here.  It's not the best movie of all time, but it works magic with every fiber of its being.<br /><br />The film tells of film star Don Lockwood as he struggles to transition himself from `silent' film star to `talkie' film star.  His frequent costar and rumored lover Lina Lamont is a selfish and spoiled diva whose voice is just not suited for film, so a young and talented singer named Kathy Selden is hired to dub her voice for their upcoming film.  When Don falls in love with Kathy things get out of hand.  Lina is furious and it becomes apparent that their love affair could sink the whole picture.<br /><br />Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor make a wonderful team here, feeding off each others energy to create some of the most impressive and widely acclaimed dance numbers in musical history.  Solo they are spectacular, but together they are even better; and what is so awesome is that when Debbie Reynolds (who is so refreshingly spunky here) jumps in she makes the perfect pair into a vibrant threesome.  The real scene stealer though is Jean Hagen.  She may not sing or dance but she acts her tail off, delivering an iconic comedic performance that will have you rolling in your seats.<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time (I tend to prefer the dramatic and depressing films, so this was a nice change of pace).  I've since seen the film again and loved it just as much if not more the second time around.  This is a film designed to make you smile, and is succeeds at doing just that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) is a pure delight!<br />All of its songs were composed by that prolific team of Arthur Freed and Nacio Brown, and not just the few sung by the main characters. There's references here to dozens of familiar tunes written by these talented men back in the 1920s and '30s.<br /><br />Kudos to Jean Hagen, who is simply remarkable as the always repulsive, forever screechy Lina Lamont. The character is based on Norma and Constance Talmadge-- Their star-rank careers came to a sudden end with the advent of talkies because both had heavy Brooklyn accents and unpleasant voices.<br /><br />A description here of the movie's most famous sequence, "Broadway Melody."<br /><br />In this extended number, the new-to-New York Gene Kelly enters briskly from stage left. He wears a straw hat, striped jacket and black frame glasses and carries a valise as he gaily calls out the opening phrase, "Gotta dance!" Kelly is then ushered into a fast-paced NY world. He quickly rises from burlesque clown to baggy pants vaudevillian to a tuxedoed gent in the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Kelly becomes infatuated with the beautiful girlfriend of a gangster (Cyd Charisse in a stunning green gown) and the two perform an elegant fantasy ballet. From here it's all downhill. The small town boy ends up as he started: on the street. Although now clad in a fine suit of evening clothes, the enthusiasm is gone-- he looks mournful.<br /><br />At that moment, another new arrival strides rapidly from stage left. He's dressed just as Gene was when he came to Broadway and he sings out the same "Gotta dance!" Gene's spirits revive. He happily calls back and the production ends on a high note.<br /><br />The entire story is most entertaining and like all great films, it holds up well. The above sequence is nothing less than stunning and if you've never seen it before, you are in for the rarest of treats. Highest recommendation to Comden & Green's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN!<br /><br />This classic musical is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006DEF9">DVD</a>.<br /><br />Also recommended--<br />The "American in Paris" suite from the 1951 Gene Kelly/MGM musical of the same name may just be the most beautiful ever committed to film.

Its story line deals with the earliest years of the motion picture industry when the painful transfer from silent movies to "talkies" was revolutionizing the world of entertainment, a time when the film industry was still trying to decipher the proper mix for the medium; action, adventure, romance, attractive women and handsome men? Not initially knowing for sure what the expectations of the audience were they simply threw in everything along with dancing, singing, extravagant stage numbers and a lot of "Old School" vaudeville routines.<br /><br />Recently viewing 'Singing in the Rain' on DVD now 56 years since it release I must admit that this homage to 'Old Hollywood' now seems so alien and remote in style and tenor when compared to modern day cinematic productions. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm left to wonder whether the song and dance of the 40's and 50's can still capture an adoring audience of new, younger fans?  If you're fascinated by the Golden Years of Hollywood and the styles and fashions of the time, this is a great glimpse into the glitz and glamour of those early days. If you aren't then this may not be the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>This movie isn't just a masterpiece, it is lots of fun to watch.  It is really enjoyable.  The songs are wonderful.  The story is amusing, and the dancing is infectious.  The actors seem to be having so much fun, the audience just can't resist.  If you love movies, you can't miss Singin' In The Rain.  It's just wonderful.  The extras are great on this DVD.  The commentary is one of the best I've ever listened to.  Just plain buy this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Signing in the Rain has to be the best musical ever. Debbie Reynolds is perfect in her role, and her voice is amazing. Gene Kelly is completely amazing, one of the most talented movie actors ever. And Donald O'Conner is just amazing. But Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont was my absolute favorite.<br /><br />This movie gave us great classic songs like "Good Morning" and "Singing in the Rain". This is a great fun musical. I completely enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>Kelly is at his second best when it comes to his dancing here if you want to see that Kelly watch An Amercian In paris. But if you wanna see Kelly at his overall best buy this film.  Evryone knows the plot boy meets girl, girl disses boy, boy gets girl, problems with life and career and EVERYBODY SING!!  But it's the problem with life and career that gives Rain its snap.  it follows in the same vein as All About Eve as it attacks the film industry but it does so in an even nastier way-it mocks its own genre of film(musicals) to mock Hollywood. Kelly also co-directed this film to good affect but obviousily Donen was in charge.  All the actors are at their foot tappin best and O'Connor steals the film with his brain tattooing number &quot;Make 'em laugh&quot; Reyonlds to is a delight but at the time Kelly hated her and gave her hell on set(he felt she was a scene stealer). But the film is a classic and everytime he walks Reynolds home adn the opening to &quot;Signing In The Rain&quot; begins to swell the volume on my TV goes up and my face always lights up in amazement of the lyrics, Kelly's voice and his dancing.  this movie is a joy to watch and complete misery if you don't have it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>This is a revisit to a movie I haven't seen in years.  Have I changed my view?  Nope.  In fact, watching the film on the new Blu ray disc more than confirms that the film still holds up after 60 years.  The video transfer maintains the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. While the images aren't quite as natural as you might like, there are very few distractions.  The colors are spectacular and the dancing is the greatest ever put on film.<br /><br />Gene Kelly seen here in his prime and in a tuxedo, could have been a great James Bond.  Cool, good looking with beautiful women all around.  Dancing never had a better stud.  Donald O'Connor is a second banana here, but check him out in his solo routine, "Make `Em Laugh".  He teams up with Kelly in a couple complicated numbers and you will never see better choreography.<br /><br />The story centers around the time when silent films made the transition to "talkies" (1927) and Kelly's leading lady couldn't make the jump due to her high pitched Brooklyneze voice.  Her voice and singing are later dubbed in by a newcomer named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds).  She's also Don's (Kelly) new fling.  This is all fun, inside stuff but the real action is on the dance floor.<br /><br />The film of course, features Kelly's take on the title song, which I've seen dozens of times.  It is still spectacular.  I had forgotten about the 13 minute dance sequence in the last act featuring Kelly and long-legged Cyd Charisse.  She dances throughout this number with a 30 foot long scarf flowing behind her.  It wraps gracefully around Kelly several times.  It is beautiful to watch, as is the whole movie.<br /><br />While the film in this Blu ray version is visually an upgrade from DVD, the audio is the real star.  The newest option is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It's a big deal.  The songs in particular have been given a wonderful mix.  The LFE channel is restrained keeping focus suggested by the original mono score.  Special features include a new documentary, commentary by several of the stars and others and a "jump-to-song" feature.  This is a pretty bare bones package (one disc) for what is a milestone film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>I just viewed this classic motion picture about the transition from silent films to talking pictures after seeing it, albeit severely edited, in my History Of Film class. I wanted to see it uncut and enjoy it for myself. I'm so glad my mom rented the film for me.  Gene Kelly co-directed this fantastic production with Stanley Donen, in addition to starring the the film. Joining him are Debbie Reynolds (my gosh, she was absolutely gorgeous and still is), Donold O'Connor, Jean Hagen ("Adam's Rib"), Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno (who would play the tragic princess, love-struck Tuptim in "Rodgers & Hammerstein's The King & I" and win an Academy Award in 1960 for Best Supporting Actress in "West Side Story.")<br /><br />The most popular sequence is when Gene Kelly is performing the title number in a street full of puddles; he had a 102 degree fever while filming the scen, but ever the professional, he didn't tell the producers or Stanley Donen until after he had finished filming the scene. He also choreographed the amazing dance sequences himself. My personal favorite musical numbers are "You Are My Lucky Star," "You Were Meant For Me" and, of course, "Singin' In The Rain." I can't stop singing it now and I love it.<br /><br />This is the way movies were made back then and, with the exception of Walt Disney Pictures and a few period films ("Ever After: A Cinderella Story," "Sense And Sensibility," "William Shakespeare's Hamlet" (1996), etc) the major studios in Hollywood don't make films like this anymore, which sucks. I recently wrote a paper on violence in the movies and how the graphic violence in films is causing kids to kill others (the Columbine massacre; in 1972, there was a nasty rape case in Britain that had odd similarities to a scene in "A Clockwork Orange" (a film that I never plan to see). The following is a sample of my conclusion to my paper (I got an A on it by the way, thank God).<br /><br />"Unless movies are based on classic literature ("Bram Stoker's Dracula,"<br />"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," etc) or a historical event (the horrible persecution of Christians in ancient Rome, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the sack of Rome in 1453 A.D., etc), movies with graphic violence should not be made; movies that use these things for source material only inspire interest in the literary work or historical event."<br /><br />The film is rated G, though it was made before the Motion Picture Association Of America (MPAA) was established in 1968. I highly recommend this excellent picture for film buffs & dance lovers everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>I am 27 years old, so the era of the big musical was well before my time.  Consequently, I've never acquired a proper taste for them.  I do admit, though, that when isolated and out of context, a good musical 'number' can be a beautiful thing: athletic grace, pin-point choreography, a snappy song, all combining together to create a whirling dervish of kinetic energy on the screen, and a visceral thrill in the heart of the audience.  But in the middle of a story, when all the characters break into (superfluous) song and dance, I get annoyed.<p>I mention the above because I've seen Gene Kelly singin' in the rain a couple of dozen times.  But I'd never seen Gene Kelly in &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.<p>On numerous Hollywood retrospective TV specials, Gene's damp little moment in the street is always accounted for, and I've always enjoyed it.  But I shied away from the movie because, as outlined above, I wondered how it could be as magical when my particular tastes don't want it in the movie?  Well, after having seen the full movie for the first time only recently, I'm here to report, to like-minded individuals, that it maintains all its magic and then some.  <p>This is true probably because the moment is integrated into the story.  It is the culmination of a lovely moment, and an expression of the joy overflowing.  When the other musical numbers are likewise integrated, the film works beautifully.  For a script written after the songs were chosen, with the sole purpose of swiftly getting from song to song (Hey!  Isn't this the story within the movie as well?  Self-reflexivity in a Gene Kelly picture?  Who'd have thunk it?), the story moves along at a nice pace, and rarely is there any questionable narrative logic.<p>But when the musical numbers are superfluous to the story, the film drags.  It appears padded, as if the producers found themselves in the enviable position of being severely under-budget, and decided to blow their wad on grand spectacle.  These numbers always work on their own, though.  &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; is a gargantuan set-piece that is stunning on so many levels, and includes the sensuous moves of Cyd Charisse.  &quot;Moses&quot; finds Donald O'Connor and Kelly caught in rapid-fire linguistic duel at the elocutionist's office, and then a stunning dance dyad.  But neither scene really fits into the story (although the former is almost saved by a funny tag-line).<p>Said story, when it's utilized, is actually quite clever.  Silent film stars Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) must learn to adapt when sound infiltrates their ranks.  One problem: Lina has a voice like an ill parakeet.  Enter Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) a singing-and-dancing pixie who may solve all their problems, while she steals Don's heart.  Throw in happy-go-lucky music man Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) who lightens the mood when needed, and there's your story.  It appears quite frothy on first glance, but is really a deft satire on the Hollywood star machine.<p>The three leads are all, on top of being obviously talented, terribly charismatic.  Kelly never lets that sparkling grin leave his face, even when he's dancing with the grace of a gazelle and the power of a boxer.  O'Connor is a mess of limbs and joints, but will amaze and stun you with his vast array of near-acrobatic moves.  And Reynolds, only 20 at the time, may be unrefined and inexperienced, but she more than matches her male co-stars' energy and gusto.  And her voice, especially on &quot;Good Morning&quot;, is just so bright and cheery you can't help falling for her.  Hagen, for her part, plays a character that's both the villain and the comic foil.  She is strong in both parts of the role.<p>Besides the wonderful musical numbers, the film has a number of sharp comic moments.  Don's recapping of his and Cosmos' early career, where the myth he presents to the media doesn't match the reality, is a funny extended sequence.  The test-screening of &quot;Dueling Cavalier&quot;, Don and Lina's first sound film, is a riotous example of 'Murphy's Law'.  And of course there's O'Connor's famous &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot; routine, which most certainly achieves the goal of its title.<p>So against my better judgment and contrary to my prior experiences, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.  Its story moved me, its comedy tickled me, and its singing and dancing wowed me.  While not nearly as coherent as I would have liked, you can't ask much more from a movie whose only goal it to entertain you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Singin' in the Rain (Stanley Donen, 1952)<br /><br />I have long held to a belief that Fiddler on the Roof was the only decent movie musical ever made (unless you want to count Pink Floyd: The Wall as a movie musical and not a long-form video, or The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which I guess is more a musical than anything). I have now come to understand that I've just been watching the wrong movie musicals, because Singin' in the Rain is about as delightful as they come.<br /><br />Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) comes to Hollywood looking to make it big in the movies. He quickly hooks up with composer (and funnyman) Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, who comes perilously close to stealing the movie), and together, the two of them make great silent films with Lockwood's ultra-popular, but shrewish behind the screen, leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Lockwood, meanwhile, has met someone he actually likes, a dancing girl with a marvelous voice named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). The voice comes into play with the advent of talkies; Lina Lamont has a voice to match her personality. What to do?<br /><br />I've been (no pun intended) dancing around this review for weeks now because I just don't know what to say about this movie. It's just out-and-out wonderful. Even if you think you don't like musicals, give it a shot; the music is much better-integrated here than it is in most musicals I've had the misfortune to come across, and of course the dancing is first-rate. This ain't world-famous for nothing. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Delightful movie that not only showcases Gene Kelly's wonderful talents, but that of Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds as well. This movie has a great sense of humor, poking fun at the early talkies in Hollywood, as Kelly and O'Connor team up to put on a new musical.  Debbie Reynolds is not content to supply the voice for the screechy voiced Jean Hagen, who is the reigning star of Hollywood.  Hagen gets her come-uppance in the end in a riotous closing sequence.  But, the signature piece remains the scene where Kelly quite literally dances in the rain after being smitten by the lovely Debbie Reynolds, who seems so fresh and fair in this movie, like an April flower.  The three lead actors play so beautifully off each other, making this one of the most memorable musicals of that era.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XN6MBYDBTX16.html">A1XN6MBYDBTX16</a><br/><p>This is a must see musical for the entire family.

And that was my case. That film of 1952 looks back at the great shift in the cinema from silent movies to talkies and the drama it may have represented for some artists who could not adapt. This film adds to that some nasty aspects of that change, of silent films (and that has not really changed), how everything is artificial and nothing but a glossy appearance. Those actors and actresses love one another in so bizarre ways at times, and they have to cope with producers and directors. But the film is funny because so many elements are shown as ironical, humorous or just plain hilarious, not to mention some cruelty here and there. Then the plot is sentimental and even romantic with a complete rift between a fake mediatic love affair and another secret and deep love that is no affair at all but a passion. The film amplifies that rift by giving to the mediatic mistress the voice of a goat and her impossibility or rather unwillingness to train herself into some kind of drinkable vocal sound, drinkable for the audience. So the studio invents dubbing and the actress is dumb enough to want to speak to her audience who liked the voice on the screen so much. The shock is so hard that they require a song and then the dubbing has to be revealed and that is the end of a career that gets silent and mute because it should have stayed silent and mute, but vanity requires adulation and worship and then a voice has to be put on the nice face and it is the discovery of the lie, of the illusion and the public never takes it with a grain of salt when they discover they have been fooled. That film is famous for one song though it is a singing and dancing treat from beginning to end, an allusion to the career of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and some others, but with a touch of realism in the behavior of these Hollywood people. And that touch is the best fun of the film: vanity has no limits and vainer than I you die. A real treat of entertainment and an important page in the huge history book of the cinema.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>All the elements of a great musical seem to be evident in this 1953 movie, but for some reason, it just doesn't gel as well as other MGM musical classics of the era such as the Hollywood talkie-craze satire, "Singin' in the Rain", or even the lightweight expatriate romance, "An American in Paris". Directed by the masterful Vincente Minnelli, the movie centers on a fading star named Tony Hunter, a once protean movie star dancer trying to make a comeback on Broadway in a misbegotten musical production of "Faust". That he is portrayed by the legendary Fred Astaire goes a long way to make this a wonderful viewing experience. His singing, especially his rendition of the melancholy "By Myself", is charming and relaxed, and his dancing is beyond dazzling.<br /><br />The problem is that Astaire is called upon to play a temperamental has-been, but his dapper elegance seems at odds with the requisite edge to make him entirely convincing in the role. The other problem is his leading lady, Cyd Charisse, a phenomenal dancer but a blank slate as an actress.  As a star ballerina looking for a broader audience, she makes line readings sound like Sunday school recitals. The supposed fight between their characters once they are introduced never seems more than a contrived plot device. However, when they dance together, nothing else matters. Two of their numbers are classics of the genre - the conciliatory and stunning "Dancing in the Dark" pas de deux on the MGM-only Central Park set (mimicked memorably to comic effect by Steve Martin and Gilda Radner on a "Saturday Night Live" skit years later) and the long, Mickey Spillane-inspired "Girl Hunt" ballet sequence toward the end with Astaire as a private eye and Charisse a slinky femme fatale. Astaire also has a wonderful number near the beginning, "Shine on Your Shoes," where he dances with an effortless partner in Leroy Daniels, a real shoeshine man who sang and danced as he worked and the inspiration for the number. These three numbers make the movie worthwhile to see.<br /><br />The remainder of the film is about that would-be "Faust" musical and all the stages of writing, casting, production, choreography and rehearsals, including failure on the road, that finally make it a Broadway hit though in a completely altered format. Some of this is sharp and clever, while the rest is just tired and clich&eacute;d, especially in the often forced banter between the unctuous Nanette Fabray and the eternally dour Oscar Levant, who are acting the parts of the screenwriter duo of Betty Comden and Adolph Green. In properly pompous fashion, British stage star Jack Buchanan plays Jeffrey Cordova, the musical's director-producer-star with enough artistic pretensions to make Andrew Lloyd Weber blush. I don't feel the other famous musical numbers have aged well - the oddly discomforting "Triplets" number with Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan prancing on their hidden knees and the ending "That's Entertainment" seems bereft of true energy. I can only guess that the fluctuating tone of "The Band Wagon" may be a case of a veteran filmmaker who is too familiar with the musical genre and defaults to by-the-numbers direction when not inspired. Compare this to the frenetic energy and youthful casting of "Singin' in the Rain" where you have a fresh newcomer named Stanley Donen out to set the world on fire. See this movie for the unparalleled dancing but be aware that the acting by the two leads and the backstage plot do not match up to the magical dance interludes.<br /><br />The new two-disc DVD set includes several extras. Liza Minnelli and singer Michael Feinstein provide overly effusive and not always relevant commentary on an alternate track, and there are trailers for eight of Astaire's movies also on the first disc. On the second disc, there is a new 35-minute, making-of documentary with the surviving cast members (including Charisse and Fabray), as well as the Vincente Minnelli installment of "The Men Who Made the Movies" series produced by film critic Richard Schickel. Also of interest is a deleted number - which has already shown up before in "That's Entertainment Part III" - with Cyd Charisse lip-syncing to India Adams' voice and dancing as a mulatto in "Two-Faced Woman". It was understandably cut but recycled for Joan Crawford looking even more foolish in "tanned" make-up in her musical drama, "Torch Song".</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>There are 3 or 4 great musical number in this film, and that's all.  The plot is about entertainers endeavoring to produce a musical comedy based on Faust.  Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray provide a little comedy relief, but only the musical numbers stand out.  That's Entertainment is the most memorable.  Astaire has some fine dance sequences as always, and is good paired with Cyd Charrise in one scene and Jack Buchanan in another.  Astaire, Buchanan, and Fabray also do a cute number as baby triplets.  For the song & dance, it's worth viewing once or twice, but not over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Don Lockwood: Cosmo, call me a cab. <p>Cosmo Brown: OK, you're a cab. <p>So what's the greatest movie musical of all time? Well, The Wizard of Oz is good. The songs from The Sound of Music are still being hummed to this day. Credit must also be given to the demented but widly entertaining South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. But the granddaddy of the genre has to be Singin' in the Rain. Seeing Gene Kelly dancing drenched down the street has become one of the most iconic of movie images. Never has there been a better leading man for the Hollywood musical. The movie chronicles the transition period when silent films evolved into talkies by showing all the amusing growing pains producers, directors, and actors experienced. You can't help but smile when you see microphones being hidden wherever there was room or shudder when you hear the shrill voice of a silent film star who's career will come to an abrupt end with the advent of the voice track. Mix brilliant supporting turns by Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds into the equation and the result is classic cinema. The Good Morning number and the Make 'em Laugh number still amaze but what can top the Singin' in the Rain number? It's timeless and a fitting legacy to the great Gene Kelly.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>The women Lena's with the squeaky high voice, honestly, are you kidding me? Just spare me. So unnecessary, so irritating and soooo over dramatic and kill switch, volume off. Sure the dance numbers spectacular if not over done. I am a lover of musicals, old perfection: 'Till the Clouds Roll by, American in Paris, White Christmas, Jazz Singer,' Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, Scrooge (Albert Finney), Cabaret, Victor/Victoria, all amazing! Sound of Music, well not only best musical ever, unarguably, but one of the finest films ever made, Oliver! LOVED IT, Fiddler on the Roof (Topol I mean come on, EPIC!), the King and I (EPIC), even Sweeney Todd, awesome, Newsies FUN!, just fun.<br /><br />This was just f'in boring. JUST drill a hole in my skull boring. I consider myself a film fanatic. I loathe critics like AO Scott and the neanderthal moron Roger Ebert, so my opinion in the grand scheme of things is just words, but this was just garbage. (with all due respect to Gene Kelly of course).<br /><br />The last thirty minutes was so great, so well done, the singing and dancing were wonderful. I wish they had just shut their mouths when they weren't singing and dancing, because I know 11 year olds that could act better.<br /><br />Laughable, ostentatiously 'vanilla' Broadway robot acting, pretentious film.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>overrated. As a musical review it works pretty well and there are lively scenes, most effecticly from Jean Hagen. Her impersonation of a dumb silent star(modeled after Judy Holliday who turned the part down because she felt it was  too small) is one of the great parts in movie history.<br /><br />The story is alarmingly thin and only an excuse for a singing or dancing number("It`s morning - yes and what a looooooooooooovely morning.... SINGING; "Good Morning.... " to name 1 of many incidents)...<br /><br />The numbers are the best from MGM, Kelly, Donald O`Connor but works only as an excuse for showing off. However, the transition-scenes from silent to sound, the preview and the finale are treasured moments - but again - thanks to Jean Hagen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>I have to start off by agreeing with John Grabowski, who reviewed this movie only two days ago.  Singing In The Rain is a three star movie, not anywhere near being one of the greatest movies of all time, and for those of you who call it the greatest, I have to wonder why you are saying that.  This is a good movie with strong music and dance performances but be real, it is what it is, period, a three star movie.<br /><br />The one "five star" thing about it is the famous dance number by Gene Kelly to the title song.  Kelly is so happy, so graceful, it's a pleasure to watch.  Perhaps that is all that the other reviewers are thinking about when they give the entire movie five stars.  But the rest of the movie is a bit dopy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Singin' in the Rain is considered by many (including myself) to be the best musical ever made.  A pleasure from start to finish, it is actually more than a great musical...it is a great movie.  Small wonder it ranks on the AFI list of best movies as number 10 and also finishes in the AFI top twenty for comedies and romances.<p>Is it a perfect movie?  Well, that may be saying too much, but I can't think of a single flaw.  Even the Broadway Melody/Gotta Dance sequence which I used to think was overly long as a kid now seems as great as the rest of the movie.  But my single favorite scene (and I doubt I'm far from alone here) is Gene Kelly dancing and singing the title song.<p>I don't want to overly hype the movie and create unrealistic expectations, but I do think this can be enjoyed by almost anyone; although fifty years old, it is still as fresh as anything made today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE TWO DISC DVD NOT THE SINGLE DISC AS AMAZON TENDS TO MIX REVIEWS FOR BOTH EDITIONS.<br /><br />Arthur Freed started his career at MGM as a songwriter with Herb "Nacio" Brown.  Then, he became one of MGM's most respected movie musical producers, the famous Freed unit.<br /><br />MGM decided to pay tribute to Freed by creating a movie around the songs that he wrote.  This became Singin' in the Rain.  Additionally as most of the songs were written for early movie musicals, therefore, the film is set in Hollywood at the advent of sound.<br /><br />Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the stars of Monumental Pictures.  Lena believes that Don and she are a personal couple besides an onscreen couple.  On the way to the premiere party for his latest film with Lena, Don meets movie star wannabe Cathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).  It's love at first sight but Cathy doesn't want to admit it.<br /><br />But Don has bigger problems.  Talkies are coming.  Production is shut down on his current film while it is rewritten for talkies.  Don and Lena go into training for talkies.  Don takes to it perfectly, unfortunately Lena's voice is like nails on a chalkboard.<br /><br />Don tracks down Cathy and after a long night of commiserating with Don's best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), the team come up with an idea on how to save the movie.  Lena will lip sync to Cathy's voice.<br /><br />All goes well at the movie premiere but Lena is blackmailing the studio to use Cathy as her voice in all her films.  In the end, Lena is her own worst enemy.  Cathy and Don live happily ever after on and off the screen.<br /><br />This is a light piece of fluff that perfectly captured the early days of Hollywood.  Broadway librettists Betty Comden and Aldoph Green wrote the screenplay.  Having a team that understands book musicals and movie musicals helped with creating the films authentic flavor.  And having film veteran director Stanley Donen paired with star Kelly as co directors works extremely well and adds depth.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor by this time were film veterans.  While for Debbie Reynolds this was her first musical and she actually proved to up to the veterans.<br /><br />The big movie within the movie production number is a classic re-teaming Kelly and Cyd Charisse.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS:<br /><br />Disc One -<br /><br />Commentary by Debbie Reynolds with Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, Kathleen Freeman, Stanley Donen, Betty Comden, Adloph Green, Baz Luhrman and film historian Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Singin' Inspirations - Seven additional sequences from other films or newsreels are referenced into the film.

How did it revolutionize the film industry in the late 1920's and for actors who could not talk?  The plight of the latter is immortalized by Jean Hagen, in the performance of a lifetime as Lina Lamont, an actress with a loud and squeaky voice.  As someone says, "Lina's a triple threat-she can't sing, she can't dance, and she can't talk."<br /><br />The movie's three main stars are Gene Kelly as matinee actor Don Lockwood (and the movie's co-choreographer); Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Seldon, the pretty actress Don loves; and Donald O'Connor as best friend Cosmo Brown.  All three are wonderful, and Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown give them fabulous songs to sing:  "You Were Meant For Me," "All I Do is Dream of You," O'Connor's show-stopping "Make `Em Laugh," the title song, "You Are My Lucky Star", and the overwhelmingly colorful "Broadway Melody" climax.<br /><br />The production values here are so colorful and irresistible-cinematography, production design, and costumes just don't get any more beautiful.  The movie is drenched in gorgeous color in every scene.  One could get drunk on this movie's visuals!  How, pray tell, they all three areas lose out on Oscar nomiations the year after AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (1951) swept the awards?  What was the Academy thinking?  Maybe one or two of them won for PARIS.  At least Adrienne Fazan DID get nominated for editing on SINGIN'.  Among the actors, only Hagen got nominated--and should have won the Oscar.<br /><br />The version of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN that I am reviewing and that you should buy is the 50th anniverary double disk DVD from Warner Home Video.  Disk one has the movie shimmeringly remastered and with a lavish audio commentary by just about everyone still alive in 2002.  Disk two has two magnificent and informative documentaries, one on the Arthur Freed Unit at MGM and one hosted by Reynolds on the making of SINGIN'. Also on disk two are generous original movie excerpts from more than a dozen other MGM musicals that first used SINGIN' songs, and a deleted Debbie Reynolds song that someone had the brains to save in the vaults.  It is a glorious total set--under $25-- and worthy of this greatest of color musicals.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>"Singin' In the Rain" and the scene with Gene Kelly splashing around, singing the title song, are on many top ten lists for film, and this film is definitely on my list, as well, and with good reason.  I really do think that this movie (filmed in 1950) was truly ahead of its time, and had the spark, the intelligence, the biting wit, the terrific score, the fabulous dance numbers, and the stellar cast that remains timeless today.<br /><br />"Singin' in the Rain" takes a behind-the-scenes look at the silent film stars of the Roaring Twenties cinema, whose careers were put in possible jeopardy when "talking pictures" were first introduced.  Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a handsome, charismatic and talented Vaudvilian performer who took a leap into silent film.  His career as a man who spends film after film miming, overacting and mouthing romantic and heroic words behind a film score background are in trouble when a "talking picture" demo is presented at a Hollywood party.  His leading lady (Jean Hagan) happens to have a terrible voice that could never be transferrable to sound photos, no matter how beautiful she is.  Don also meets beautiful Kathy Seldon (nineteen year old Debbie Reynolds), a young woman and aspiring dancer who hesitates to admit her adoring love for him as an avid fan of his films.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many priceless scenes are in this film.  The humor is warm, genuine and very, very funny.  The musical numbers are first rate.  The "Make 'Em Laugh" number with co-star Donald O'Connor is physical comedy and agility at its best.  He was a brilliant dancer and comic.  If I listed all of the dance and singing numbers, I would need more room!  Please view this film with family, friends or anyone you know who enjoys comedy, music, dancing, and entertainment at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Singin' In The Rain is one of those rare films where everything works: casting, music, sets script and costumes. The two disc package by Turner Entertainment helps the viewer to see and understand the place of the musical in American film history.<br /><br />The story of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Conner) and  Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) is familiar to most viewers. The inside look at Hollywood in the time of the transition from silent film to talkies has been covered in other places but nowhere is it as effective as it was in this 1952 film.<br /><br />The Special Edition Package contains a weath of material that has been restored completely. The film is in spectacular Technicolor and looks even better than it did when it played on the screen. There is a commentary with nine participants hosted by Debbie Reynolds that covers just about all aspects of the production process. A feature called Rell Sound provides clips from films that were critical to the sound to talkie transition. A branching feature on Inspirations for the film gives three segments of hidden footage relating to specific scenes. The first disc is rounded out with the original trailer and some cast and awards information.<br /><br />The bulk of the special features are on disc two. The disc starts with the feature length Musical Glorious Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM. This feature highlights the life and work of the famed producer. A second feature What A Glorious Feeling is a 35 minute retrospective coving the making of the film and is hosted by Debbie Reynolds. There is an extended selection of excerpts of the Freed-Brown musical numbers taken from their original films. This is a wealth of material that puts the songs from the film in perspective. The final section of the disc gives us the original MGM Orchestra scoring sessions for just about all of the music in the film.<br /><br />This is a well put together package that is a joy to watch. It is essential viewing for any fan of the MGM musical period.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of "An American in Paris", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.<br /><br />The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, "The Dueling Cavalier", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - "I love you, I love you, I love you".<br /><br />All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very acceptable speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number "Make 'Em Laugh" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Singing in the rain is probably the highest quality DVD I've ever had. Its luscious, saturated colour, enchanting songs, performances of the dedicated talents and wonderful script all make it a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />The trivia behind the scenes are actually equally amazing. Special salute to Debbie Reynolds (19 year-old then) who danced and sang her heart out to meet high expectations, suffered great fatigue and feet injury after numerous takes. Story had it that Debbie Reynolds, after being told that she was not able to dance, had the advice and help from Fred Astaire to pull it off. To Donald O'Connor, at the age of 27, who still ran up the wall and performed a somersault, repeated the demanding act several times on screen, only to be hospitalised and later found he had to do it all over again after the film negatives were lost in a fire. To the uncredited choreographers who also dubbed the tap dance. Behind the glorious feeling and sunny mood of the film were total dedication and committment of these admirable talents. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won my sympathy as the self-conscious arrogant but stately star from the silent film era. It's no concidence her sharp voice echoed that of Judy Holiday in Born Yesterday. Jean was Judy's understudy in Born Yesterday the stage play. It's easy to get all the glory for being the leading role, yet Jean hagen and Donald O' Connor should win high praise for making the picture complete. The more I watched the movie again, the more I admire their work. Gene Kelly had a fever when performing the title song.<br /><br />One last point, Don Lockwood (Howard Keel), Cosmo (Oscar levant), Lina Lamont (Judy Holiday) - these were people once considered for the parts. Singing in the Rain manifested the glory of film making as well as the high demands and commitment of people, on and off screen, to churn out  work of such high quality. Hats off to their hard work!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Only the cloudiest of curmudgeons could possibly begrudge a musical as pervasively buoyant and consistently inventive as this 1952 classic. Thanks to the unstoppable creative energy of Gene Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen and the sharp writing of the redoubtable team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, what could have been just another MGM confection is really a non-stop singing and dancing entertainment and a clever satire on the talkie revolution that transformed Hollywood's movie industry in the late 1920's. Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary, two-disc set released in 2002 is an appropriate tribute to this film since it includes a pristine print, clear audio and plentiful extras.<br /><br />Kelly's athleticism and natural braggadocio manner are put to optimal use in the fictionalized story of silent screen stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, both of whom make a particularly bumptious transition to sound with their romantic costume epic, "The Dueling Cavalier". Thanks to the introduction of primitive and awkwardly placed microphones, the stars' mute over-emoting looks and sounds ludicrous, in particular, Lina's Bronx-accented helium squealing. Off-screen, Don can barely stand Lina, and what's more, he becomes smitten with young ing&eacute;nue Kathy Selden much to the consternation of Lina. After the movie's disastrous preview, Don's best friend and piano accompanist Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea of turning the potential fiasco into a musical, "The Dancing Cavalier", with Lina's unbearably comic voice dubbed by Kathy.<br /><br />While Lina uses blackmail to keep Kathy under wraps, the plot still comes to its inevitable conclusion but not before an elaborate and rather anachronistic production number, the fourteen-minute "Broadway Melody Ballet". Although not as enthralling as Kelly's similarly lengthy tribute to the French master artists in "An American in Paris" the year before, this number has all the razzle-dazzle one could possibly hope for in a single number, including the leggy Cyd Charisse dancing flawlessly as a coin-flipping femme fatale. In fact, the whole film is so energetic and saturated with color that it's hard not to be enraptured.<br /><br />Most every musical number is a memorable classic from the classroom antics of Kelly and O'Connor in "Moses Supposes" to the ebullient furniture prancing of "Good Morning" to O'Connor's acrobatic turns on "Make `Em Laugh" to Kelly's classic rain-drenched solo set to the title tune. Kelly is inarguably at his peak here, and so is the youthful O'Connor who proves even more than the females, to be Kelly's most compatible dance partner. Nineteen-year old Debbie Reynolds is kewpie doll-adorable as Kathy and dances with hard-earned ease with her veteran colleagues. The scene stealer, however, is Jean Hagen who plays the not-so-dumb Lina with genuine comic &eacute;lan. You will also notice twenty-year old Rita Moreno playing a Clara Bow-like movie star named Zelma Zanders.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a wonderfully insightful if somewhat crowded commentary track with participation from O'Connor, Reynolds, Donen, Comden, Green, Charisse, and co-star Kathleen Freeman (who plays Lina's failed elocution teacher), as well as film historian Rudy Behlmer and director Baz Luhrmann. Most of them also participate and repeat their recollections in a thirty-minute featurette on the second disc, "What a Glorious Feeling" made specifically for the DVD. There are two other shorts - one on the first disc called "Reel Sounds" which details the evolution of the sound picture during the setting of the movie, and the other is a lengthier 1996 documentary, "Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM", which provides a broader view of the classic MGM musicals of the period.<br /><br />There are also trailers, some outtakes and antiquated movie excerpts of songs written by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, who penned "Singin' in the Rain". All in all, this is a terrific package for a most deserving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is one of those handful of films that is universally loved and respected and I have to join the crowd on that. For over 50 years it has been considered the best musical ever made and I can't argue with that, either, especially with the newly- restored DVD version that came out a short time ago. The film never looked and sounded better!<br /><br />In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song "Singin' In the Rain," featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish.<br /><br />A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good. In fact, one of his solo routines reportedly exhausted him so much he could not work for five days. A nice bonus is seeing Cyd Charisse in here, showing off her dancing skills and great legs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is the definitive Hollywood musical, and charms and delights our 21st century audiences despite the (very few) characteristics of the genre that don't hold up quite so well.  <p>There are so many high points to this movie -- the amazing cast, the songs, the choreography, and, most surprisingly, the satirical send-up of Hollywood and the &quot;star system.&quot;  <p>The plot is well-known.  Silent film star couple, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, who also co-directed with Stanley Donen) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are America's sweethearts.  At a Hollywood premiere of their latest romance, breathless fans ignore sidekick Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, in perhaps the best sidekick performance in film history) and scream in delight as Lockwood and Lamont pander to their adoration.  Nobody, however, seems to notice that the gorgeous Lamont never speaks . . . <p>Her imposed silence Lamont has a voice that recalls a cat with its tail caught in a wringer, although Lamont is such a &quot;dumb blonde&quot; (bless Hagen -- nobody ever played this stereotype better!) that she is blissfully unaware of her screech.  No matter, 'cause it's the silent film era, right?  Wrong!  Progress brings in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and the era of &quot;talkies.&quot;  No longer will clever staging of press events suffice.<p>Soon, Don Lockwood is staring career meltdown in the face as the first Lockwood-Lamont &quot;talkie&quot; sends the audience into hysterics.  Not only is Lamont's screech audibly offensive, they can't keep the sound synchronized to the film, and the sound editing even when in synch is as amateurish as a high-school film production.<p>What to do?  Fortunately, Lockwood had fallen for young, beautiful Kathy Selden (a teenage Debbie Reynolds), a starlet in the making.  Cosmo comes up with the idea of dubbing Selden's voice for Lamont's, and all is fixed . . . or not.  Lamont, an imbecile but smart enough to know her value, insists on ruining Selden's career to preserve her own . . . and so on and so forth.<p>The plot, ingenious as it is, is really secondary.  The main delight in this movie is the amazing dancin' and singin' that the performers offer up.  While most of it is pretty silly, campy stuff (particularly the Kelly-O'Connor set pieces), they simply dazzle.  Kelly is the most robust, athletic dancer of his generation, and O'Connor, well, the man doesn't have a bone in his body.  While the movie's most famous scene comes from Kelly splashing in puddles during the title track, the most amazing dance number has to be O'Connor's comic flailings in &quot;Make 'Em Laugh,&quot; where he runs up walls, flirts with a mannequin, and generally pulls out all stops.<p>Debbie Reynolds does a magnificent job keeping up with these two giants, and is generally a pleasure to watch, even though she's clearly outclassed as a hoofer.<p>While some great old films seem to get better with age (think &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is an American classic that does not hold up quite so well in some minor respects.  For example, when breaking into choreographed step, Kelly, O'Connor, and Reynolds sometimes appear too rigid, with smiles frozen on their faces, which is incongruous to those raised on more modern musicals like &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; where the dancers take a more naturalistic, emotional approach to their dancing. The dancing in &quot;Singin'&quot; holds up, but the performers were constrained by the expectations of their audiences, which somehow demanded that the performers &quot;look pleasant&quot; while dancing.  <p>Still, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; remains one of the best tonics to a foul mood ever . . . I defy you to watch this movie and not feel a smile creeping over your face.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>"Singin' in the Rain" is often considered the greatest film musical ever made (Though some would probably disagree, preferring "The Sound of Music" or "West Side Story" instead). With so much happiness, it is impossible not to like this movie. Unless you have a problem with feeling good, you should see this movie. <p>The cast is dynamic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds all show real enthusiasm as though they want to star in the movie, not "I was forced to by my contract" or "I did it for the money". Despite the fact it runs at less than two hours, this movie packs more excitement and great music than most dull, three-hour musicals combined. With enormous laughs (The biggest provided by O'Conner and Jean Hagen), great dialogue ("Why, I make more money than - than - than Calvin Coolidge, put together!") and fourteen wonderful songs including "Fit as a Fiddle", "Beautiful Girl", "You Were Meant for Me" "Make Em' Laugh" and "Good Morning". But the one everyone remembers the most is the title song, sung as Gene Kelly dances, twirls and, of course, sings in a storm (Stanley Kubrick later used the song in a less flattering way, but that's another story). I have also seen few movies take such beautiful and generous use of Technicolor. <p>As many fans should know, this gem turns fifty this year. Perhaps Warners (Or whoever owns the rights) should celebrate this golden anniversary by putting out a special edition DVD. Better yet, I would love to see this projected on the big screen. If you're listening out there, don't hesitate. Many others are waiting like I am.</p></br></body></html>
