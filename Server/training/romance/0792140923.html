I thought I wouldn't do it justice. I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.<br /><br />Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role.<br /><br />I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is special. In a wierd way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldnt want anybody rushing to see me.<br /><br />The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is compareable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.<br /><br />My favourite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny "Cause you're my girl" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says "I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.<br /><br />I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too. This, and American Beauty are the two best films I have ever seen. I pray I watch a film I like almost 60% as much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I'm going to disagree with a couple of other reviewers on here, and say this is a great movie. Why do people have to over-analyse things? And another thing: does Forrest really get the girl in the end? Cos if you watch right to the end, technically, he doesn't. In a way.<br /><br />My mum is a big fan of Tom Hanks, and watches Green Mile over & over, but whenever I suggest another Tom Hanks movie to her, she doesn't fancy it. I managed to sit her down in front of this, and she really enjoyed it! I love this movie, despite the length, and it has a great many stars in it: Robin Wright Penn, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise, to name but a few.<br /><br />I especially love how when Lieutenant Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, how it's done. It's fantastic! At first I thought, particularly when he was in the bed/wheelchair, that they were underneath him, or put through a hole in the bed, but apparently, his lower legs were wrapped in a special blue fabric that allowed them to be optically removed from the film by computer later.<br /><br />Lieutenant Dan tells Forrest that the day Forrest works on a shrimp boat is the day he'd be an astronaut. This is a reference to the book, where Forrest actually becomes an astronaut, and the following year, they appeared together as astronauts in Apollo 13.<br /><br />The Doors have more songs in the movie than any other band with a total of five. These are, "Soul Kitchen" (in one of the Vietnam scenes), "Hello, I Love You" (first song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), "Break On Through" (second song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), "People Are Strange" (third song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), and "Love Her Madly" (when Jenny is leaving the hotel room with a black eye after presumably resorting to prostitution).<br /><br />I love Jenny's character in this, played by Robin Wright Penn. It's the way her whole look changes constantly throughout the movie, while Forrest stays the exact same. I think the character of Kayleigh from Butterfly Effect was loosely based around Jenny's character, as both characters change so much throughout the movie.<br /><br />There's a lot of historical events in this movie, including meeting Elvis and teaching him how to dance, he met John Lennon and gave him his inspiration for Imagine (and two presidents), he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous. I think the Watergate scandal went straight over my head, didn't understand that bit at all. Everyone knows this stuff wasn't likely to ever happen, and I hate the fact that they used old news reels, and someone attempted (albeit badly) to change the words the people were actually speaking! The lip movements are very wrong.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this movie is now 10 years old, and fingers crossed, in another ten years, it'll be considered even more of a classic than it is now. If you liked the Back To The Future trilogy, and any other Robert Zemeckis movie, then you'll love this. The book's quite different from the movie, but that's worthwhile picking up cheap if you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>I really dont know what i love more, the book or the movie. Forrest Gump was one of the most distinguished and classic films of my lifetime.  Its a story of a simpleton who goes through his life with a sense of determination that seems to blow the minds of most of the people he meets.  His decisions are always pretty clear.  He spends his life doing the right thing and holding true to the first friend and one true love of his life Jenny, who due to a child rearing of molestation and child abuse cracks down and falls to heroin and promiscuous sex.  This movie is a must for any american history buff. Forrest is a part of every major piece of history he experiences in his life.  He is a vietnam war hero, he walks dead on into a landmark of what would become the tear down of segregation, he witnesses the watergate scandal and the aids epidemic.  A simple man who experiences an unbelievably full life.  The movies scenery was inspired by norman rockwell and the soundtrack is phenominal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This a great movie. If you haven't seen it you don't want to pass it up. When I fist saw Forrest Gump I thought it was a true story...lol But every movie that I watch and like I question if it a true story....lol.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>This is one of my Top 5 favorite movies of all time, as I imagine it is for many people. It may seem almost cliche now, 17 years later...but think back to how much it touched your heart when you first saw it. Then enjoy it like you've never seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>There isn't much I can say that the others reviewing this haven't already said. The writing and storytelling is wonderful, and so is the acting! You get lots of great names here - Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Gary Sinise... wow! This is not an action-packed tale of good guys vs bad guys or anything like that, but wow, it's still an awesome film!<br /><br />It follows the life of the titular main character through his childhood and adulthood (as narrated by Forrest Gump) while various people sit with him at the bus stop and listen to him. There's plenty of interesting things and events in here - his time in Vietnam, his tenure working on a shrimp boat, etc etc. If you like action, this might not be a good film for you, but if you like a good story, then definitely give this movie a try!</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>I hated this movie at first. I had to go out in the lobby during the combat scene. Even though I did not go to Vietnam, I felt like I did. Forrest moves from Elvis and The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I went to D.C. with my son. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the quintessential boomer life unfold can be painful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks is still a sweet, tearjerker, and honest film about a man who may not have all his marbles intact but his sweet nature and common sense make him special wherever he goes. Great performance by Hanks, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise. I can see why the Academy Awards gave this movie the best picture nod. This film will touch your heart and make you laugh for sure. I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that Forrest Gump is 10 years old this year. The amazing tale of a mentaly challenged man and a passionate love story.<br /><br />Forrest Gump(Hanks) lives in a small town in Alabama. He has no father and lives with his mother(Fields). Forrest is mentally challenged, but his mother won't let that hold him down. He has only one friend besides his mother and her name is Jenny(Wright). The two are best of friends, but as they get older there lives take different paths.<br /><br />Forrest has huge success. He ends up attending Alabama where he is an All-American in football. He goes to Vietnam and meets Lt.Dan(Sinise). He also meets Bubba(Williamson) who he later names his shirmping company after. He becomes a war hero and a millionaire through hard work. He is missing one thing though and thats Jenny.<br /><br />Jenny takes a much differnt path after high school. She gets into drugs and goes through the hippie movement. She does disco and does more drugs. She realizes her life is the pit, but theres one thing thats always been constant in her life and that Forrest.<br /><br />This movie is a fantastic tale of two people who take different roads but can't get away from each other. The love has always been there, but commitment wasn't. Will the two end up together, you'll just have to watch the movie because I wont spoil everything.<br /><br />Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is captivating. It's one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. He won the Oscar that year for Best Actor and it would have been a sham if he haven't. His peformance as the mentally challenged man in all the big events will bring you to tears. You leave the movie wishing you could be full of life and innocent like Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is the man and In my opinion this is top 5 performances ever. You can't help but love him. No one else could have been Forrest. Nobody.<br /><br />Robin Wright gives the performance of her carear in this movie. She's awesome as Jenny. She displays the emotions of the character so well. We can all relate to her character in a way.<br /><br />The two characters cover almost all the major of events from the 60's on to the early 80's. They stir up memories and everything looks authentic. It's magical and funny as you think back about these two love birds and the situations they are in.<br /><br />Gary Sinise gives the performance of his carear as well. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost. He should have won it over Marin Landua. Lt. Dan brings more emotion to the movie as he relates to Forrest in different ways. There friendship is special and the two change each others lives.<br /><br />Robert Zemcki's established himself as a Hollywood elite with Forrest Gump. He already had hits like Back to the Future and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit under his belt. Forrest Gump is the icing on the cake though. It's a special movie and the way he made it is beautiful. He deserved his Oscar for Best Director.<br /><br />The movie is so well made. It won Oscars for Editing and Effects and you will see why. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and it won six. It could have easily won any of the others as well.<br /><br />The DVD extras are great. There is a second disk jammed with stuff. The stuff on the making of the movie is great. The documentaries are great as well. If you love DVD extras, then pick it up. It's worth it.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a passionate love story and an awesome tail of a man, just being himself. Everybody should see this movie at one point or another in life. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a teenager. It deserves it's PG-13 rating and some people argue an R rating, but I think thats stretching it. Buy this movie and experience the phenomenom that is Forrest Gump.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump, to me, is one of the greatest movies of all time.  You get involved with a simple minded man, and see everything through him.  After seeing this movie, you almost feel like you know Forrest Gump.  You don't even expect the film to move you that much, but it does, and it takes you by complete surprise.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest American actors, and personally I do not think that any one else could've even come close to playing that role.  All the suporting cast was vibrant and interesting.  The movie all around is a classic that will never be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>This is one movie that deserved all the acclaim it got. Forrest Gump is one of the most original ideas for a movie ever created. It follows the unbelievable life of Forrest Gump and the humorous and heartbreaking journeys that he endures in war, love, and life. Hanks is wonderful as the slow, but innocent Forrest and there are so many great and powerful moments in this movie. I think it is so enduring because it is about the human experience, and we, as an audience, feel for Forrest as he must learn life and the problems life presents. It is an experience that we all must go through, and I recommend this movie to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Forrest is basically a good guy, he just happens to be kinda slow.  But that doesn't seem to stop him from meeting Elvis, fighting in Vietnam, Investing an apple and founding a multimillion dollar shrip company.  <p>Tom Hanks is brilliant and he plays the part wonderfully.  Although some elements of the book that I would have liked to see were not included it still does not take away from a wonderful proformance.  This movie will have you laughing and crying at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>In the life of a Simple Man of Forrest Gump (Oscar-Winner:Tom Hanks).

One of the few early great films from the ninties. Forrest Gump has become a Instant Unforgettable Classic for the Early Nineties. Panavision. Grade:A.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump is a rare movie that succeeded on all levels.  It was a box office smash ranking among the top five highest grossing movies of all time.  But it was also a critical darling, garnering across the board praise and a truckload of awards.  The movie became a cultural phenomenon, spawning cook books, quote books, a top ten soundtrack album and lines like &quot;stupid is as stupid does&quot; and &quot;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get&quot; have permeated our dialect.  The movie has a nostalgic, feel good vibe thanks to the dimwitted Forrest's trek through 60's and 70's touchstone events.  Underneath all those warm feelings lies a darkness.  Bad things happen to just about everyone Forrest comes in contact with.  His best friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam, his other friend Lt. Dan loses both his legs, his mother dies of cancer and his beloved Jenny dies of AIDS.  Even the famous people Forrest comes across meet with disaster, President Kennedy &amp; John Lennon are assassinated, George Wallace is shot and Elvis Presley dies young.  There are superb performances all around.  Sally Field is feisty as Forrest's mama, Mykelti Williamson is funny as Bubba, Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan is a perfect rough edged foil to Forrest and Robin Wright as Jenny portrays the confusion that young people of the times felt perfectly.  While all those performances are of high quality, Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks' tour de force.  He is utterly brilliant as Forrest.  He is in virtually every scene of the movie and never once does he fail to astound.  He becomes Forrest and makes you care what happens to him.  Mr. Hanks deservedly won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar for the role and cemented himself as the best actor of his generation and one of the best of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump is a tale of America's culture from the 50s through almost the present day, and it is brilliantly done.  Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is quite simply flawless as an idiot savant who comes into contact with most of the significant events and people of his day. I have always liked Hanks as an actor, and here he puts in an unusual and yes, a brilliant performance.<br /><br />But the real star of the movie is America of the 50s through the early 80s.  The portion of the film that dealt with the Vietnam conflict was unforgettable, as we see large numbers of ordinary American boys swept into a conflict that they little understood.  Gary Sinise puts in a very creditable performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's platoon leader in Vietnam for whom the war is a personal tragedy.<br /><br />The film hilariously shows Forrest Gump navigate through many of the key events in history during the periods.  He meets Elvis and influences his style.  He meets President Kennedy. He has a ringside seat in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He is caught up in the Vietnam War.  He meets President Nixon and inadvertantly triggers the Watergate scandal (this part is really a hoot).  The film's portrayal of the hippies and radicals of the 60s is particularly funny and in fact rings true.<br /><br />This is a film that almost everyone will like, and which will touch even the most hard-boiled viewer.  The DVD is a terrific value, and most viewers will enjoy watching this one many times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>This film has so many little things going for it.  Little things that add up to one big masterpiece.  The story of the slow-witted man who triumphs works, of course, because of the performance of Tom Hanks.  But there are a lot of other things that contributed. <p>First was the script.  I have a big problem with books being altered for movies, especially when they change the physical appearance and essence of the character.  They do that in this film, but I still make an exception because it took the character to new levels.  The book was funny and somewhat farcical, but that character was basically still a Southern hick.  This move adds a lot of dimension to this by showing the feelings this man has.  <p>But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.  He ultimately triumphs because of his basic decency.  His determination to do the right thing, and stick with those he believes in gives him his ultimate rewards.  A world full of Forrest Gumps would not produce super-computers, but it would be a world where people get along a lot better than they do in the current one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>When I saw this in the theater in 94, I thought it was amazing!<br /><br />It was funny, it was sad, it had everything.

The story is so fantastic, and original!<br /><br />Buy the dvd, don't rent it, you'll never forget this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>For everything this film lacks, Tom Hanks more than makes up for with a brilliant performance that only he could pull off. Forrest Gump is a simply Alabama mamma's boy, with a 75 IQ. He befriends Jenny, who he soon sees as the love of his life, becomes a football star, and so on and so frth through history. In fact, it turns out that Gump has been involved in just about everything from American history from 1950-1980. Its a fun movie, with help from a great performance by Sally Field as Gump's mother, and another one from Gary Sinise as the disabled Lt. Dan. There's some great visual effects, and its a fun movie with a little bit for everybody.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a southern boy who is not so much bright. He is in love with a girl name Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn ) who is Forest's friend, but just likes him as a friend. He's known her ever since they were little. She then moves on in war and peace marches of the Vietnam War, which then leads Forrest to go to fight in the Vietnam War. His friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) gets killed and Forrest promises to help Bubba's family with the mortgages. He then meets Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who gets his legs blown off in the war. Which then loses his money and Forrest invests with him in a fishing business. Forest then sadly loses his mother by a fight against basically old age. Jenny then comes back to his life and realizes he has a kid. Jenny then loses a fight with a bad cold which then dies. A very sad film with Forrest Gump has to move on.<p>It is a very sad tragic movie that can really move you. It can be very touching, which can make you drop a tear. It is very moving which if you haven't seen you got to watch this film. It is a must see if you haven't. I don't really think it should have won best picture, I liked it but I liked Pulp Fiction better. Tom Hanks's performance is very great and truly deserved the Oscar. It also can be very heart warming in a sensitive way. The cinematography in this film is very breath taking. It can blow your mind. This movie can touch anyone and when you stop watching this film, it's just a feeling you can't explain.<p>This DVD includes commentary by Robert Zemeckis, Steve Starkey and Rick Carter, but it would have been better if they had commentary by Tom Hanks. It also has behind the scenes, art design featurattes. This is a 2 disc set DVD, and widescreen. It also has the trailer and TV spots of the film. It also has interviews with the cast and crew. With Tom Hanks, Robert Zemeckis and more. This could have had better features though like the backstory they had on AMC. Other than that these special features are pretty good. You have to get this film or if you haven't seen it you need to watch this spectacular film. A definite must.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump...what is there to say? Excellent movie. It's seeing history and telling it from a point of view. Many people, who were not in the era, do not realize how everything was, until they see this movie. With history is the whole 'true love' plot, which goes well for the movie. This movie is definitely one of my favorites, my friends and I can remember it word for word and we use many quotes till this day. I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc. I look at it as a drama and to me, drama has a little bit of everything in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>In my mind, I had the bare bones of a scathing review that would showcase my slyness and writing skill. I was ready to hate this movie. Dumb guy juxtapositioned into great moments in history? Life is like a box of chocolates? Tom Hanks? Much to hate. However, I enjoyed it. If you ever see a guy in a white suit waiting for a bus, don't sit with him or he'll tell you his life story. I jest. It's a fine movie.<br /><br />My dislike of Tom Hanks goes way back to a sitcom called BOSOM BUDDIES, built on the unbelievable premise that the only way these two guys could find an apartment was to dress as women. What I noticed, week after week, was that Tom Hanks' lack of talent dragged down Peter Scolari. I've also seen Hanks in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE GREEN MILE and APOLLO 13, and he did nothing in any of them to raise my opinion of him.<br /><br />(APOLLO 13 works because a skilled ensemble cast and a wooden "hero" to lead them can be a highly effective device. Schwarzeneggar built a career on this, and I don't fault him for it.)<br /><br />But I can't conceive of anyone except Hanks as Forrest, Forrest Gump. He was excellent. I'm also proud that I immediately recognized the young actor from THE SIXTH SENSE when he was but a brief flash of hair. He has a presence that we'll enjoy for many years.<br /><br />The marketing department dropped the ball on this movie. They made it sound like I'd learn some deep life lessons from a guy with half my IQ. An offensive premise, and I don't even believe in IQ tests. It's not like that at all. It's such an unusual juxtaposition (there's that word again) that nobody knew how to pitch it accurately. Sometimes it's like that. We're authors. We know this better than anyone. I may hunt down the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>This film is a denunciation of generational excess.  The film spotlights some of the traumatic disasters and cultural phenomenon, the curious history of the 60's and 70"s, a watershed for boomer youth; God help us; it has marked us all.<br /><br />I guess if your top button is buttoned and your pants are hitched up, and if your hair is cut severely, then you have the Tom Hanks look for a Southern fellow that's mentally deficient, though he can run fast enough.  I agree with other reviewers, it's a Tom Hanks career highlight.  He is the good-hearted bumpkin that bumbles his way with honor.  The plot juxtapositions Hanks solid, folksy morals versus raw evil or angry ambiguity.  He knows there is his mother and there is a God.  That is powerful life-fulfilling fuel.<br /><br />In contrast, Forrest's childhood friend Jenny is lost.  Robin Wright plays the sexually abused cracker's daughter.  She's plenty smart and is perceptive enough to realize that Gump is a sweet friend, loyal.  However, she's on the run most of her life, drugs and 60's rock and roll and then LA and disco coke parties.  Naturally, after each of her prodigal returns to Forrest, she loves him physically, but she cannot love spiritually.  She does not find peace till she exorcises her lifestyle demons, seeking comfort in Forrest's arms; then there's the bittersweet finale.<br /><br />To booster my theory, Gary Sinese as Gump's Vietnam Lt, loses his legs in battle.  Gump wins the Medal of Honor by saving his platoon and Sinese too.  Lt. Dan is from a military family and is bitter that he has lost his legs rather than dying heroically.  Again and again, Sinese's post-Vietnam life is in turmoil as he is flabbergasted by Gump's successes.  The good Lt.is bitter in his cups.  Later in the shrimp boat storm scene, Sinese finds the Secular Hollywood God; literally he is baptized.  (Does Sinese really have legs or not.  Amazing special effect or they used an actor with stumps.  Ya got me?)<br /><br />Yes, there is a religious message:we are ruled by destiny and we float in the air like a feather simultaneously,an obvious Christian message that is never spoken as the PC crowd grapples with eternity.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The title character leads viewers through an accidental travelogue of American social history from the early 1960s through the present in this revisionist fable.

This film does not so much contain a story but a series of random events that our hero stumbles into(Stupid is as stupid does).  What is most impressive about Robert Zemeckis' direction is how CGI is utilized to integrate his characters into historical events.  What least impresses is how these techniques detract from the characters.  What distinguishes this film is the acting, particularly Tom Hanks as Forrest.  Yes, Forrest has an I.Q. of 80, but he's nobody's fool.  What ingratiates you to this character is that he has a heart a mile wide.  This is a tricky bit of acting that Hanks does here because playing somebody who is mentally challenged is a slippery slope(If you want an example of how not to play the mentally retarded,see or don't see Cliff Robertson's performance in "Charly").  The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with Gary Sinise as the embittered Lt. Dan, Robin Wright as Jenny(though I thought it too much that she had to suffer so many indignities), Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, and Sally Field as Forrest's mother.  This film in subsequent years has been criticized, fairly or unfairly, as sappy or condesending.  What I would add to that is the public took this character into their bosom.  I think it's a fair assessment that you can fool at least some segment of the theatre going public.  I don't think this film would have been the phenomenon that it was if the public thought they were being taken for a ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>a special guy sits on a bench and tells anyone who will listen about his story book adventure style life.it stars tom hanks.he is abselutely hilarious while simaltaneously being simple and blissfully unaware.the kids can watch it but they should really not look when jennys around.shes a whore and a half.it is easily the best tom hanks movie ever made.this movie is for everybody.if you do not like this movie you need help because something is seriously wrong with you.it is a very emotional movie from watchimg gump struggle to walk as a child up to when his loved ones began dying.if you are the sensitive type,do not forget to take your prozac or youll ball your eyes out.the only chick in it is jenny.she toys with forrests emotions throughout the entire movie and puts out at least 9 or 10 times.there are a lot of people who play thier roles well here.most everbody does well.its one of those movies you have to watch on tape because it never stops being good long enough to stop for a snack or a bathroom break.its that good!if a second one were somehow dreamt up it would be only a shadow of its predecesser.it is long,but an abselute gem in any video library.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>What's there not to like about this film? It seems to have everything: crisp direction, outstanding acting, a compelling narrative, life lessons worthy of affirmation, highly innovative special effects, and a soundtrack whose CD continues to be a bestseller. It received and deserved five Academy Awards and could have received others as well. Of special interest to me is director Robert Zemeckis and his crew's brilliant integration of material from Winston Groom's novel with historical material in the 1960s and 1970s. I am not referring to Sonny Shroyer as Paul ("Bear") Bryant or Peter Dobson as a young Elvis Presley; rather, to the inclusion of footage of John F. Kennedy and George W. Wallace in scenes in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) appears. What is fact? What is fiction? Who cares?<p>Another question: "Where's Forrest?" At various points in his life, he is outrunning childhood tormentors on bicycles, scoring touchdowns for the University of Alabama, attending a White House reception, proving himself worthy of a Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in Viet Nam, attending a major peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial, launching what becomes a highly profitable shrimp company named in honor of a Viet Nam comrade, defeating international ping pong champions, creating a "smiley face" which makes another person wealthy, jogging thousands of miles throughout the United States, re-settling in his family home, reuniting with a young son he did not know he had, marrying his beloved Jenny....<p>Some people have told me they think this film is "corny" and that Forrest is "dumb." If "Stupid is as stupid does," what he accomplishes suggests otherwise.  However, who he is as a person is far more important to me. I admire Forrest because he is a thoroughly decent man whose wisdom cannot be measured by I.Q. tests or net worth. I would be proud to have him as a son or son-in-law, as the father of my grandchildren, and as a next-door neighbor. Who wouldn't?<p>FYI: The special features which supplement the DVD version of this film are among the most informative I have examined thus far. Why is that not also true of so many other great films? Perhaps Mrs. Gump is right: "Stupid is as stupid does."</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>You never know what you're gonna get!<p>Forrest Gump is without a doubt one of the best films of the 1990s.  Very unique, very original, very wonderful!  And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.  <p>2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.  <p>Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!<p>The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.  Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!<p>Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!  <p>Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability. <p>Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.<p>Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.<p>Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.<p>2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.<p>Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.<p>&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Academy Award winner Robert Zemekis and two time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks bring the epic Forrest Gump alive at times funny hilarious and rediculous at other times it has alot of heartwarming moments and strength to pull it off as<br />an enduring human spirit film.

Most movies are about the bravest, the strongest, and the most beautiful / handsome as they plow through their lives. In Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks is instead a man who has many challenges in life. His legs won't work properly. He is not smart enough to be allowed in a traditional school. But through the perseverence of his loving, single mother, he gets the foundation in life, the moral strength, and the perseverence to thrive.<br /><br />Forrest absolutely does not have an "easy life". His mother was abandoned by her husband and runs a boarding house. She pours all her love and dedication into raising her son to be able to take care of himself and to be content. She sleeps with the school's principle when he tells her that Forrest can't go to school. She tells Forrest repeatedly that he is just as good as anyone else, and that life is unpredictable and that that is normal. The line in the movie is: "Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." It's become so popular that it is now almost cliche. It's important to remember that it GOT popular because so many people relate to its meaning. You might like the flavor of a chocolate, or dislike it, but it's all part of life, and you go on and have another one.<br /><br />Hanks shines in this, as does Sinise, and both are well deserving of the many awards they won. Forrest is not one dimensional. Yes, he is not a genius. But he is still a complex character. When Jenny turns down his marriage proposal, he stares at her for a moment, then tells her, "I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is." With the conviction in his voice, and the emotion in his face, you know absolutely that he does.<br /><br />Some of the movie is a bit heavy-handed. The repeated insertions of Gump into seemingly every single important moment in American history - including teaching Elvis how to dance, meeting with multiple presidents, and so on, can seem a bit much. He invented the smiley face. He happened to invest in Apple. The music soundtrack suffers from this "club on the head" issue. When Jenny leaves an abusive boyfriend, the sountrack sings "don't you love her madly as she's walking out the door" just as she does.<br /><br />But then there are moments when I am powerfully affected, every time I see this movie. When Jenny was little, her father abused her. Forrest doesn't quite understand this, but later in life when they're both adults they return to her childhood home. Jenny starts throwing rocks at the house, furious at what her father had done, and then collapses. Forrest feels her pain, and says, "Sometimes, I guess there just aren't enough rocks". He knows exactly what she's going through, inside, and gets to the core of the emotion.<br /><br />It is a bit sad that, even though the two most important people in his life are his mother and Jenny, the two never interact at all. And those two women never seem to interact with any other women. So this movie is all about Forrest, all his male friends, and then the men around his mother and Jenny. So we have an entire movie full of men and then "the mom" and "the love". I would have appreciated greatly a more rich world.<br /><br />But, still, this is a problem with just about every movie, so it's hard to fault Forrest Gump too much for this flaw. And the movie does embrace a wealth of issues. Dan deals with life with no lower legs. Forrest deals with his mental challenges. Jenny is a survivor of child abuse. Forrest's mom struggles as a poor single mom. Together they all make it through their challenges.<br /><br />Well recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>If you haven't, see it.  It is worth your time.  Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance and the movie consistently provides something to chew on.  You would never think that a person like Forrest Gump could be involved with so many things in his life, but he is, perhaps oblivious to the significance of it all, but you love him nonetheless.  There is hardship, but Forrest conquers all, and it ends nicely.  You are probably going to want to see this movie again at some point, so buying it may be a good idea.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump, based more or less on the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, is my second favorite film of all time. It always manages to cheer me up, or make me laugh, or make me think. Plus I love all the retro footage and sets, being a big fan of all things 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a young man who isn't that smart, but still has gone on to lead an interesting life. His life leads him to all sorts of places, and he gets to meet all sorts of people, some of them celebrities of the day. He goes to college, he goes to war, he goes on TV and even to China. He loves his mama (Sally Field) and a girl named Jenny, who he has known since the first day of school (Robin Wright Penn). Sometimes it seems as if he has a destiny, other times its like he's floating round on the breeze. Maybe it's both. Whichever way, it certainly makes an interesting ride.<br /><br />There are so many things I love about this film. I love the character of Forrest, the way he looks at things, the way he talks and interacts with people. I love the soundtrack, a mix of songs contemporary with Forrest's adventures in the 1960s and 1970s. They really add to the mood of the film, plus usually are relevant lyrically, which is a nice touch, I thought. I love the look of everything in the film, which helps the atmosphere just as much as the music. I love how this movie can make me laugh, make my cry and make me think. I love how there's always something thematically I haven't noticed before. Though it's about a not so clever man, I do believe it's a very clever film.<br /><br />Since I love the film so much, I find the special features really interesting. Between the featurettes and the commentary, you'll discover where Lieutenant Dan's legs went, where Tom Hanks picked up Forrest's accent from, why director Robert Zemeckis chose the music he did and how they managed to get so many famous people of the past to make appearances (even though most were dead). It's pretty thorough.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommened. It's a great, colourful film with plenty to look at and consider.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>This movie is quite unlike any you have ever seen. It is a magical mystery tour through the formative times of the baby boom generation, with a simple and guileless man as our guide. Forrest Gump is like the literary character created by Richard Powell, whose "strength is as the strength of ten because his heart is pure". The world around him spins like a top, slowly wobbling until it falls, and through it all Forrest's simple character acts like a rudder in the water. He steers us through exciting and troubled times, from the rise of Elvis to the fall of Vietnam, the cynicism of Watergate and the nasty hangovers from free love that wasn't so free and one too many trips on the Marrakesh Express. The movie deftly captures this space in time with the perfect blend of music (that just slaps you in the head with its freshness and lack of premeditation) and images that are culled from the back pages of your mind. It skips like a stone across the hopes and dreams of a once idealistic generation that were launched like a rocket into space, only to suffer a fiery reentry as it all came crashing back to earth. What a ride. We lost our innocence, but Forrest did not lose his. We lost our heroes, but Forrest shows us true heroism with his own simple example. We lost our way, but we can find it again. This movie is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Screen favorite Tom Hanks proves that even the most unlikely soul can change the world in the award-winning 1994 blockbuster "Forrest Gump". The movie chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted Alabama man who has been present during significant historic events in the 20th century. In his life, Forrest Gump has been an All-American football star, a Vietnam War hero, a champion Ping-Pong player, a successful fishing tycoon and an inspiration for a whole generation. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), "Forrest Gump" is a remarkably uplifting smash hit that ranks as one of the best films of the 1990s. Tom Hanks delivers his most entertaining acting performance. "Forrest Gump" features an unforgettable story, great special effects and terrific performances by Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field. The 142-minute blockbuster opened with overwhelming positive reviews, grossed over $650 million worldwide and earned six Academy Award wins including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.<br /><br />"Forrest Gump" Collector's Edition is an absolute must-have for any DVD collection. The 1994 blockbuster is presented is its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-Disc DVD contains an enjoyably well-defined video transfer and an excellent 5.1 Dolby digital sound. Its supplemental extras include two detailed audio commentaries by director Robert Zemeckis and crew, the 30-minute "Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump" documentary, behind-the-scenes and visual effects featurettes, trailers and picture gallery. Overall, "Forrest Gump" scores a winning "A".</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>OK, I know what you're thinking: what's the matter with me that I didn't see this long ago? Well, in 1994, when it was in the theaters, I would not have gone to it without Steve, and he wasn't interested. And we never owned a DVD player. So I've really only had about three years or so to have come across it. Nobody who told me about it told me enough to appreciate that I probably would like it, including that Tom Hanks (the guy from "DaVinci Code," but I didn't know the name then) was someone I would love as a terrific actor. Anymore than I would have believed I'd love Leonardo DiCaprio in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" until I saw him in "Titanic." In fact, he was so convincing in Grape that I thought it really was played by a retarded guy, just like the mother really was played by a morbidly obese woman. I mean, no actor can fake it that well, can they?<br /><br />Apparently some can.<br /><br />Forrest is not seriously retarded, after all, he's just "a little slow," as his mother (Sally Fields) puts it. She's determined to see that he gets the best education possible. Very determined, as the principal of the school finds out. The other thing is he wears braces on his legs. Why? The quack his mother took him to acknowledges there's nothing wrong with his legs, but his back is "as crooked as a question mark." So why do braces on his legs have anything to do with curing his back? We never do find out. But one day when Forrest was being chased by bullies on bicycles, and is running as fast as he can, the braces just break and fall off, and he's running like the wind.<br /><br />Forrest also has a friend, Jenny, the girl who let him sit beside her on the school bus the first day, and they were "like peas and carrots" after that. Always together. He figures she's his girl, but she doesn't quite see it that way. In fact, as they go through life, they keep finding and losing each other.<br /><br />I won't go into all the details, but the basic premise of the story is that Forrest is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus, and gets talking to whomever sits next to him, whether they answer or not. Most of the story is thus told in flashbacks while he tells his experiences in a simple, straightforward way. He's met three presidents, the first one Kennedy as he was on an all-star football team, the second was Johnson as he was awarded the medal of honor for bravery in Vietnam (great story there; I'll let him tell it), and the third was Nixon, because of his central role in the "ping pong diplomacy" with the Chinese.<br /><br />In fact, he seems to always be involved in something which we remember from the news, one way or another. Not for anything he figures is all that special, but just for doing his job or for sheer coincidence. For example, when he meets Nixon, the president asks him how he likes Washington, and does he like his hotel. I don't remember what Forrest answered, but Nixon says he'll be more comfortable in this nice new hotel that only recently opened. That night he's in the Watergate and calls the front desk to report that "they must have had a power out over there because there are people walking around with flashlights and everything." Next thing you know, Nixon is resigning.<br /><br />He makes friends here and there, and these people keep popping up in his life in unexpected ways. Still, coincidence is never strained too far, because Forrest has gotten famous, so people who want to can find him.<br /><br />There's a lot of humor, and a lot of pathos, and they are mixed together just right. You won't pity Forrest, but you will learn to see the world through his eyes to an extent you would not have thought possible when the movie began. It's artfully done, and I'm not at all surprised that it earned six Oscars, including best picture. It's one of the best I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>FORREST GUMP is one of the most amazing movies i ever seem...Tom Hanks SHINES here...maybe his best movie....One of those films that make you wanna cry...really nice...i saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and it really touchs me....BRILLIANT! BRAVO!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>How do I begin to describe one of them most incredible films of the last 50 years....I can't. I just can't do it justice. But I will do my best to tell you how this movie has affected me. Every one of you has seen this film. The whole world has seen this film. There is nothing I can say to those millions of you who have seen this All I can do, is give you my review.<br /><br />I will not go into detail. You already know every scene, every line. I just really wanted to have my say posted by Amazon.<br /><br />The obligatory `cliff note' is Tom Hanks plays the part of a mentally challenged man whose life interacts unwittingly with persons of fame and politics.  He has no ides of the impact he has in people's lives. and simply sees the world `as it is', and yearns for the love of his life, his Jenny. In fact, everything he does, is driven by his love for Jenny.<br /><br />You will never EVER see a better performance by Gary Sinese, as the physically and severely soul wounded Lt. Dan. EVERYTHING he has done since this movie, is compared to this role. Robin Wright Penn will never have a role as perfect as she had as Jenny, the woman he has loved since childhood, but shuns him repeatedly, in search of her own life. And as to Tom Hanks? Well, he is one of the premier actors of the modern era, and his performance in Forest Gump eclipses even his role in `The Green Mile' (my other favorite film). Hanks so `under-plays' his simple-minded Gump character, to the point of diamond brilliance. In the end, he finally get's his life's desire, and hears the words he waited for his whole life, from Jenny..."I love you". And then, she is sadly gone. But we get a glimpse of a whole new beginning in his life, with his son (played by Haley Joel Osment).<br /><br />Yeah, I know there is nothing new in this review that really describes the film. My point was, is, watch this movie on DVD as often as you can. Not only will it enthrall you, it may just make you a better person. The emotion in this film is so tangible, if it does not make you weep at the human condition, than you have no heart.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>The movie is about the legitimate and profound power of optimism, persistence and character.  Those themes are timeless and probably expressed better in this film than any other of the last twenty years.<br /><br />On first and on last viewing, though, I was disconcerted by the "run, Forrest, run" motif.  The moral message seemed to be that there are circumstances where we should just run from adversity.  This is first shown where a truckload of young men are chasing teenage Forrest in Alabama, throwing rocks, etc.  Robin Wright shouts at him to run, and, since she's the one who tells him to run, he runs.<br /><br />Of course, Forrest's running later leads to repeated heroism.  But I was still a little thrown off by this, because we're not always supposed to run, are we?<br /><br />Well, you never know exactly what you're going to get.  I guess sometimes the wisest thing to do is run rather than stand and get killed.<br /><br />If Forrest were now in Iraq instead of Viet Nam, what would he do?</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This singular picture was a superb surprise in that time.

The endearing film follows the life of an educationally challenged man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) from the time of his childhood (played by Michael Conner Humphreys) until early middle age.  His mother (Sally Field) made sure that he would be treated just like everyone else so that he could take care of himself once she was gone.  In addition to his learning disability, Forrest was required to wear leg braces as a child that made him the target of ridicule from other children, except for one girl named Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall).  However, Forrest quickly discovered that his legs weren't that bad when he found an innate ability to run.  When Forrest decided to join the U.S. Army, he meets his two best friends: a fellow recruit named Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).  Bubba loved to talk about shrimp and Lt. Dan was raised to be a soldier.  Forrest's relationship with Jenny, as well as his relationships with Bubba and Lt. Dan, led Forrest down several unexpected paths that allowed him to meet several pivotal historical figures.<p>Tom Hanks' superb performance as the loveable Forrest Gump earned him his well-deserved second Oscar for Best Actor.  (He had previously won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and has been nominated three other times.)  Robert Zemeckis also earned the Oscar for Best Director, and the film itself won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.  Gary Sinise earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, in addition to six other Oscar nominations that included Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound.  Part of what &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; so endearing was Zemeckis' use of superimposing actors into actual, historical film footage.  This footage included the late Pres. John F. Kennedy, the late John Lennon, the late Pres. Richard M. Nixon, and the late former Alabama Gov. George Wallace to name a few.  (Robert Zemeckis used this same archival footage technique again in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;.)  Other memorable characters in the film include school bus driver Dorothy Harris (Siobhan Fallon), Bubba's mother (Marlena Smalls), Abbie Hoffman (Richard D'Alessandro) and Forrest Gump Jr. (Haley Joel Osment).<p>Some of the many memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes, running with leg braces, running across the football field during practice, scenes at the University of Alabama, boot camp, Vietnam, D.C., NYC, the shrimping boat, running across America, and the scenes with Jenny (both as child and adult).  I regard &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as one of the best films ever made and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's the kind of film that draws the viewer into its story and keeps the viewer engaged throughout its 142 minutes.  I highly recommend the DVD version of the film to everyone, and the second DVD is good with its various documentaries and other material.  Tom Hanks went on to star in many more memorable film roles, including his roles in &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000) to name a few.  Unfortunately, many of Gary Sinise's film roles that followed have been far less memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I know that I should love this movie since everyone else in the world does, but I can't help but get this overwhelming singe of disappointment every time I sit down to watch this movie (which isn't often, but I recently watched this for the third time thinking that maybe I was harsh on it the first two times).  `Forrest Gump' is what I consider, as my title suggests, mediocrity done extremely well.  It's what happens when you take a clich&eacute; ridden story and fill it with gimmicky characters who speak mind-numbing (albeit entertaining) dialog.  There is a layer of originality that spreads itself thin over the film, but overall the film is bogged down by its own aspirations.  It is trying way to hard and failing most of the way.  It is not a bad film, but it is no where near the top of the pack, not even in 1994, which was a sub par year in general.<br /><br />I know that `Forrest Gump' has its rabid supporters (thus the reason that every review under a five-star gets trashed by the next reviewer) and I am literally stripped of my dignity every time this movie is brought up among friends since apparently I am the only person I know who sees that there is simply nothing here to get excited over (actually I do remember one time that one of my friends nodded in agreement with me, and then his wife let us both have it).<br /><br />So I don't get yelled at, there are some spoilers below, so be forewarned.<br /><br />So, here are my issues with `Forrest Gump'.  The story is actually good in my opinion, or at least the idea behind it.  Having one man make an unintentional impact on the entire world and be utterly clueless to it is actually interesting.  If the plot hadn't been muddled with clich&eacute;d characters from the very beginning then it really could have been worked into genius.  But that wasn't the case.  The character of Forrest isn't the biggest clich&eacute; (although he is clich&eacute;d, don't get me wrong) but all the people around him (from his mother to his war buddy to the love of his life) are so `been-there-done-that' that I can't understand why someone didn't stop production and ask why they couldn't create something a little different.  The performances for the most part work to elevate the familiarity (especially Wright, whose character is probably the most clich&eacute;d in the bunch) but it doesn't really help much.<br /><br />Another problem that I have with `Forrest Gump' is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is kind of like the king of gimmick for me.  I don't think he is the strongest actor and it feels as if he relies to heavily on his characters gimmick's to elevate his performance and acceptance.  He won back to back Oscars for barely doing anything.  Really, he played a man dying of AIDS and then he played a man mentally handicapped, the two biggest Oscar bait gimmicks out there, but his personal performance was nothing spectacular.  The final frames of the film are truly the strongest, and yes, when he realizes that he has a child his reaction is raw and real and heartbreaking, especially when he asks if his son is smart, but honestly that is one scene (the best scene in the film mind you) and one scene does not make you a good actor.  Robin Wright Penn and Gary Sinise are actually very good here (Sally Field cannot step out of her character clich&eacute; long enough to do anything decent here) but there performances are muddled down by the mediocrity surrounding them.  I am not for one minute saying that no movie should be made about wounded war vets or the mentally handicapped or the drug addicted floozy, but when so much of it is thrown into the same pot it begins to feel as if no one involved with this project has an imagination.<br /><br />The film feels very force-fed at times, like it's spoon feeding the audience mouthfuls of manipulated sympathies.  I know that I am like the last person to complain about that since I cry every time I watch a Ron Howard film (talk about emotional manipulations) but Ron Howard has a way of making all that syrup go down smooth; and Zemeckis doesn't (at least for me).<br /><br />I just don't buy it.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe I am really harsh and maybe I take life way to seriously as some angered reviewers have claimed anyone who doesn't rave this movie must do.  I'm not saying that it isn't entertaining and even enjoyable.  This is just not an Oscar movie.  It's more of a C+ than an A+ in my book.  Like I said, it's done well, really well, but that still doesn't make up for the lapses in judgment on the part of the writers, directors and lead actor (at least he tries in some scenes here as apposed to his horrendously mediocre `Philadelphia' performance the previous year).  When I look back at the films that `Forrest Gump' beat out for the top prize (namely `The Shawshank Redemption', `Pulp Fiction' and the un-nominated `Heavenly Creatures') I am dumbfounded that the world fell for this living breathing clich&eacute;, wrapped in a feel good package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I can't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars.

There is the story of &quot;Gump&quot; in a nutshell. There's no great hidden politicial or sociological agenda in the story, outside of the obvious fact that life needs to be experienced, not mourned over (not a good thing to hear for a mild cynic like me). This is one of those films that was a surprise to see in my teenage years (like &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, both equally good films) and despite the criticism of &quot;Gump&quot; (and believe me when I say I've heard just about all of them and then some), I have only this piece of advice: lighten up, will you?  The DVD itself has some interesting stuff, such as several mini-documentaries of the making of the film (including two sequences that were never completed), commentary with the filmmakers, and more.  It's a movie that a somewhat cynical man like myself isn't afraid to admit he has in his film library.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump  DVD<br /><br />Tom Hanks stars in this movie about a young man who unwittingly participates in some of the key moments of the twentieth century.  I highly recommend this movie for fans of Tom Hanks and anyone alive in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Gunner  April, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Once in a great while, a movie comes along that captures your heart and imagination.  Forrest Gump is one of those rare movies.  Led by an all-star cast including Tom Hanks (Forrest), Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan), and Sally Field (Mrs. Gump), the viewer is treated to a view of Americana through the eyes of a simple young country boy.<br /><br />Through three turbulent decades, the movie describes events that were capturing headlines throughout the United States, as told through Forrest's eyes.  The viewer gets a unique look at such events as racial segregation, physical disability, war protests, and the onset of AIDS.  Through Forrest's unique perspective, the viewer is shown each of these controversial topics.<br /><br />The viewer also gets to see the ups and downs of Forrest's relationship with Jenny over the years.  From young children riding a school bus together to facing the uncertainty of AIDS, a lifelong bond is shared between them. Although leading very different lives, Forrest's love for Jenny never waivers, and in the end, Jenny finally realizes that she is ment to be with Forrest.<br /><br />The scenes in Vietnam are some of my favorites.  Gary Sinese's portrayal of Lt. Dan Taylor is simply perfect.  A by-the-book soldier who teaches Forrest how to stay alive, it is ultimately Forrest who saves Lt. Dan's life (over his protests) during an enemy ambush.  Forced to have both legs amputated, Lt. Dan slips into a life of alcohol and self-doubt, but Forrest remains his true friend, and after buying a shrimping boat, Lt. Dan joins Forrest as his "first mate".  It is here that Lt. Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life.<br /><br />The most touching scene of the movie is near the end where Forrest is speaking to Jenny at her gravesite.  Forrest tells Jenny how much he loves and misses her, all the while gently crying.  He also explains to her how proud he is of their son Forrest Jr.  In the end, Forrest and Forrest Jr. are waiting for the school bus, just like Forrest and his mother used to.<br /><br />I would give this movie six stars if I could.  Tom Hanks won an academy award for his portrayal of Forrest, while Robert Zemeckis also won for best director.  Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The acting is impeccable, and the viewer gets an interesting history lesson about life in the United States during the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  I guarantee that you won't have a dry eye after watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Forrest Gump" (1994) is a classic, iconic American movie I think will live on. It's about a generation (about 30 years) from John F. Kennedy through the L.B.J. and Nixon administrations and beyond. Much of the early movie is comic. At the beginning and end of the movie we see Forest waiting and a feather floating through the air: life goes on, the circle of life persists and endures. Forrest, mentally challenged, learns to run like a house afire to get away from his enemies and his demons.<br /> Through a groundbreaking process we see Forrest's image merged with the real images on newsreel footage of the American presidents he meets. He isn't greatly impressed by famous people, fame for himself or money. He's loving, extremely loyal, kind, gentle, na?ve, trusting, courageous, and a lot smarter about life than most of the people around him.<br />Tom Hanks, the quintessential American movie star of the last thirty years, does a fantastic job as Forrest. The movie is full of adages and sayings (like "stupid is as stupid does") that Forrest repeats and lives by. He and his mother (Sally Fields) have a deep connection, and he has one love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, Jennie. She's a sixties love child who deeply disappoints Forrest by becoming part of the 60's and 70's drug culture, but their love triumphs.<br />Because of his ability to outrun everybody, Forest Gump becomes a football star and an accidental hero in the Vietnam War saving Bubba Blue, the shrimp fisherman he's befriended. He also saves Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who eventually becomes his business partner and life-long friend. He goes into Bubba's shrimp business after the Vietnam War, and he becomes successful along with Lieutenant Dan.<br />The movie reaches into pathos, but it can be excused for those excesses. It's a classic. Life just happens to Forrest, everything is accidental, not due to his planning, but he endures as an American icon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>An OUTSTANDING film, Forrest Gump, follows the life of a young boy from Alabama as he grows up and through him sheds light not only on his life, but on modern American history as well.<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, innocence, friendship, and inner strength.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention quite a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Forrest Gump is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This is by far my favorite movie.

One of those rare movies that hits on all cylinders.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Forrest Gump, is the story of a man who is not that smart, but not "stupid" either.  He has no agenda, no plans, just a love of life and all that is in it.  He is the modern symbol of innocence, and that is why he became such a symbol after the movie release.<br /><br />The director traces time from the 50's I'd say all the way to the 70's, with tons of music along the journey.  The film was highly effective, although was often seen more as a comic endeavor.  Too many young people overlooked the overriding tale of innocence in a crazy and sin-filled world.<br /><br />Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is contrasted against his life-long love Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn.  Jenny experiences all of the mood swings of American culture, i.e., hippie culture, drug life, and so on.  However, Forrest, although he is much more face to face with the most gripping of realities, such as Vietnam and presidential assassinations, never strays from his half-minded yet picture perfect view of reality.<br /><br />I really liked the attempt that this movie made with the story of everlasting innocence and love; however, too many were distracted by Forrest's many guffaws, specifically his speech impediment.  In addition, many believe this to have a great soundtrack, but combining a vast variety of songs that were popular is not original, instead a score could have been extensively used throughout the entire film instead of using clippings of 60's/70's popular hits no matter how much we liked them.<br /><br />Also, we probably got the message way before the film was over and thus could have skipped parts of the film and been just the same.  Lastly, I did not like the hype, and was sick of all the people quoting the film.  Now, I only saw this film a few days ago, and for many that is shocking; however, this film was not as powerful as people pre-suppose.<br /><br />Yes, this film was good.  Maybe it will one day be a classic, but right now this is just a quality shrimp in a more-or-less lousy catch.</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>This is a truely amazing and magical movie and most people wonder why. It makes you feel good inside. Forrest Gump makes his way into all of our hearts by weaving himself into real American events so that we can relate to him. An innocent man sitting on a bench telling the story of his life. He may not be all there, but he touches all of our hearts. The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on. It tells the tale of a man's life, and how he changed America. Tom Hanks brings so much to the role of Forrest, being able to express many emotions and feelings. The DVD is really good, great everything. I wouldn't even think about complaining at all. Forrest Gump is a role model for all things good, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Of course you know what you're gonna get, chocolate, duh! Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career as "Forrest Gump." The director, Robert Zemeckis was creative and brilliant with his vision. It's about a slow-minded man who did everything. Ran away from bullies, fought in Vietnam, got shot in the but-tocks, met the president, played ping-pong, ran some more (this time around the country) and ate shrimp. Yes, what a life. And then he finally got Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and had a little Forrest. You could tell by a person's shoes what kind of a life they had. If you look at my shoes, you'll see dirt and dog stuff all over them. What does that mean?</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>"Forrest Gump" is the sweeping story of a simpleton (Tom Hanks) whose view of the world is both clairvoyant and poignant.  After being told that he will never walk without the aid of leg braces, young Forrest breaks free of his irons, goes on to become a college football star, a decorated war hero, the CEO of a lucrative shrimp business, and finally, a husband to the ill-fated girl of his dreams (Robin Wright Penn) and a father (Haley Joel Osmond in an early role). What makes the film so remarkable is its handling of the central character. Like Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, Tom Hanks brilliant performance as Forrest is thoughtful, introspective and fine wrought with compassion. Director, Robert Zemeckis never allows sympathy or stereotyping of the mentally handicap to override the poignancy or expanse of his narrative. Gary Sinise is magnificent as Lt. Dan Taylor - a hot shot military man until war robs him of the use of both of his legs. Sally Fields excels as Forrest's mother, a woman determined to see that her son lives a full and useful life.<p>The transfer from Paramount Home Video is somewhat disappointing. Sourced from a print rather than the original camera negative, colors are generally weak though sometimes nicely balanced. There's some age related dirt and scratches present throughout the print that, for a film of this vintage should NOT be an issue. The anamorphic framing is consistent but fine details are lost in many of the darker scenes. There's a considerable amount of film and digital grain present for a picture that, at times, is smooth, but at other times is rather harsh on the eyes. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced with a real kick in the musical score and special effects.  The extras include a documentary on the making of the film, some interviews with the cast members and director, the film's theatrical trailer and some television spots.  Overall, this is a less of a stellar visual presentation than it should have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This film could have been good if parts of it were'nt so ridiculous.

It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them).  Why this won so many awards is highly questionable.  The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice.  The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?).  Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging.  It's a rather simple performance where he's just playing an "aw, shucks" kind of guy.  The special FX were really no big deal (even though the press told us they were), and look quite ordinary today.  Reportedly, the original novel was much more satritic and darker.  I should read it.

From a sheer entertainment standpoint the film isn't too bad, at first.  Forrest goes on adventures, they are passably amusing.  The second half of the film is incredibly dull and all that sh*t with his stupid hippie loser girlfriend is unbearable. Also, though there's no denying that Hanks is an extremely good actor I'm not especially impressed with his performance here.  Everyone seems to think that affected, gimmicky performances are the most impressive thing, but I don't buy it.  Hell back in 6th grade there was this semi-retarded chick that I used to imitate for my friends and lemme tell ya my performance was spot on AND hilarious. Gimmie an Oscar, I rule the acting I do.<br /><br />But what I really hate about this movie is how it's such a major example of the baby boom generations love affair with itself.  Chuck Klosterman summed up the problems with them pretty neatly and I'm gonna quote him as best I can from memory: 'Baby Boomers are convinced that they are the most important generation ever.  THEY ended the war, THEY had things they believed in.  There is nothing more pompous and condescending than a nostalgic baby boomer.' I wish I had the exact quote, but that's the gist of it, and he goes on to note how baby boomers are obsessed with how revolutionary they are and yet they inherited the establishment and ended up keeping pretty much everything the same.  And it's not just that it's about the generation.  That's not necessarily a problem it just reeks of the whole 'God are we amazing attitude'.  I've heard it all before and I'm not interested.  However, if you're a narcissistic baby boomer, knock youself out.<br /><br />Grade: D+</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>Some people confuse this film as an all out sugar coated love fest but their are some hints of all out grim reaper in here!

He becomes famous after rescuing several soldiers in the Vietnam War, and achieving remarkable success in international ping pong.  But his heart's desire is his childhood friend Jenny, who is one of the few who shows compassion to him.<p>The insight into the life of a retarded man is wonderful.  And the acting, particularly of Tom Hanks in acting Forrest Gump, is remarkable.  Some of the special effects (eg the ping pong playing, the inclusion of Forrest Gump in real newscasts of US presidents, John Lennon, etc) are astounding.  The DVD features an explanation of how these special effects were accomplished, and they truly are outstanding.  The concept is great, but the way it is worked out is a typical Hollywood disappointment.<p>Because these are the only positives about the movie.  Several concerns:<br />1. Adult themes.  The rating is only PG 13, but there are many scenes with violence, drugs, nudity and sex, themes inappropriate for children.  The language is mostly reasonable, but there are multiple incidences of strong blasphemy and foul language.<br />2. Lack of moral absolutes.  Forrest Gump represents innocence and naivity, but yet he is corrupted by Jenny, whom he eventually sleeps with.  Even after he fathers her child outside of wedlock, she assures him that he has done nothing wrong. Jenny's death is apparently due to her lifestyle (due to her drug problems, STDs or AIDS?), and yet the dangerous consequences of an ungodly lifestyle are never connected or clearly spelled out.  She seems to represent all the dangerous things of the sixties.<br />3. Atheism.  Gump is one of the few individuals who believes in God, but this is presented as part of his retarded thinking, which like in other areas, is out of date and inaccurate.  This is especially clear in a blasphemous scene where his friend challenges God to sink his boat.  As it turns out, God loses, because every boat is sunk except theirs, and they become millionaires as a result.  Christianity is clearly presented as irrelevant for modern life.<br />4. Self-determinism.  The movie starts and ends with a fluttering feather.  It's a very religious symbol, as the movie itself explains with several discussions about "destiny".  Destiny is partly the random fluttering of fate, and what you make of it yourself.  Forrest partly triumphs by his character, but also the whims of fate (eg the success of his shrimping company is pure "chance" after all other boats sink).  God's involvement in the world is clearly rejected in favour of self-determinism.  This is a strong theme in the movie, and a dangerous one.<br />5. Trivialization.  Key events of American history are presented through Gump's eyes.  While it gives insight into a retarded man, at the same time these key events are downplayed and presented as trite and almost laughable.  Some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century are trivialized.  This reflects the failure of most Americans to treat life with the seriousness it deserves.<p>All in all, while this movie had aspects of warm humour, it also showed the spiritual bankruptcy of a modern America that has rejected God and is no longer rooted to moral absolutes.  The fact that this was awarded the Best Picture in 1993 and received a bag-load of Academy Awards just proves that it is indeed representative of modern thinking.  Interestingly some critics believe that this movie is an attack on liberalism, lambasting promiscuity, atheism, and the entire counter-culture of the 60s.  I wish it was, but the very fact of its immense popularity among modern viewers suggests that - sadly - this is not the case.  It's a sad reflection of modern American, and its popularity just confirms how accurate this portrait really is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>I've heard about 'Forrest Gump' for years, and recently I decided to rent it.  Is this movie supposed to be a cartoon?  I know movies can be unrealistic, but this movie is SO RIDICULOUSLY UNREALISTIC I found myself staring at the screen in disbelief.  What did this man not do in his lifetime?  It's as though he has been blessed by God and everything falls into his hands.  The moral of the story.. STAY STUPID AND OBLIVIOUS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND MIRACLES WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>History is one thing when it's told in a book, it's something amazing when it's told by "Forrest Gump" The incredible story of the good hearted low IQ man from Alabama and his the highlights of his life that made him famous. He's a war hero who recieves the medal of honor, a football star, a shrimp boat captain, a ping pong player and a national celebrity, he's met 3 presidents- Johnson,Kennedy and Nixon, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Dick Cavett. The Story also follows his personal life with his mother, his friends Dan Taylor and Bubba Blue and the love of his life since childhood, Jenny. One of the most extrodonary, inspiring movies of all time, terrific entertainment, a top notch classic, brilliant, Hanks is the greatest actor of this age. Winner of 6 Academy including Best Picture, Best Actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis- the man behind the Back to the Future Trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is one of my favorite films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Or words to that effect; I think it was Woody Allen  who said that. and Forrest Gump embodies the "Just turn up" principle; that is pretty much the only "point" to this film.<br /><br />There does not seem to be any statement in this film that Forrest has a purpose. He just follows his nose, and things happen. Maybe if more people did this, they might enjoy what they have in life, and get more out of the precious moments we have in life.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this film is superbly entertaining. If you have a good script, and a Great cast, then all you need is a Zemeckis to create visually good material, and masterful special  effects  to back it all up.<br /><br />The end result is that a very moving, dramatic, funny, and ultimately emotional film will result.<br /><br />if you find something deep and meaningful in this film, then good for you, and if you find something else in this film, I would question why you would watch a film; at its heart, this film is superbly crafted. It cannot but be with the people who created this work.<br /><br />The imposed meanings that some reviewers assert tell more about the reviewers than they do about the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended as great entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW.html">A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW</a><br/><p>Shawshank Redemption... Need I say anything more.  This film took some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century and trivialized them.  Not to mention the fact that it gives the unthinking viewer the idea  that stupidity works.<p>I'm not in favor of book or movie burning but if I  could destroy every copy I would.  If there is a more dangerous movie than  this one I hope I never see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>After reading the book, I wonder how they came up with this movie. Forrest Gump went to outer space and crash landed back on Earth on a deserted island. He got pulled into the space program for throwing his Medal of Honor at the capital and hitting a Senator in the head with it. Anyone who can sit and watch Tom Hanks act like this retard for more than 15 minutes at a time has got to be in a coma.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>"I don't remember being born, I don't remember what I got for my first birthday and I don't remember going on my first outdoor picnic ... but I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in whole wide world." -- Forrest Gump<br /><br />I have to be honest with you and just say that I'm a fool for sentimental movies like this. This is actually one of my all-time favorites. I usually find myself disappearing into this movie during flu season and when I'm confined to the couch for a week suffering in pain. Watching Forrest Gump seems to make things better, sooner.<br /><br />While that might sound corny, and you might be rolling your eyes, I usually feel better every time just watching it. The truth about the success of this movie is that most people identify with it, because unless you're a sycophantic sociopath, there are many times when the majority of us feel inferior, or less than or unable to meet the demands of our life - rendering us a little blue, sad, debilitated ... take your pick. Knowing that there is someone in the world like Forrest, probably gives us the hope that you're going to be alright if you hang on and don't obsess on your flaws. Forrest Gump is a lot of different things to different people. Mostly, it just takes you out of whatever you're in and does a pretty consistent job at making you feel that much better. Even if it's just for a little while.<br /><br />I'll spare you the repetitious information regarding any technical information about the DVD or the cast, as to date there are 543 reviews on this, 397 "5 star" and 42 "1 star", and 10 pages of posts on IMDb.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated that this was an introspective look into the Baby Boomers generation, and while I've never been a fan of the Baby Boomers per se, as most of the would-be flower children that briefly took up residences in communes, would later switch-off and drift into the largest group of corporate raiders in the history of this nation. Not much of a legacy there. But the character of Forrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey. Forrest Gump is an amalgam of several people, this according to Winston Groom and the reason why so many people identify with it. While <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743453255">the book</a> is a worthy and interesting read, the film trumps.<br /><br />"I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is ..."</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Year of release: 1994<br />Writers: Winston Groom (who wrote the novel) and Eric Roth<br />Director: Robert Zemeckis<br />Runtime: 2 hours 22 minutes<br /><br />I haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.<br /><br />"Forrest Gump" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any creedance to their judgment ("American Beauty," best picture? Please) but "Forrest Gump" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.<br /><br />Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exagerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:<br /><br />-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talant.<br /><br />-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: "If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none."<br /><br />-- Mastering your talants will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).<br /><br />-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.<br /><br />-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.<br /><br />-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).<br /><br />-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.<br /><br />-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).<br /><br />-- Keep your word.<br /><br />-- Pray and have FAITH.<br /><br />-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.<br /><br />We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.<br /><br />From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means "struggles with God" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?<br /><br />Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a "golden connection" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: "One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor."<br /><br />Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).<br /><br />"Forrest Gump" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>This movie was and IS a classic. From the first moment to the last, this movie is touching, moving, action-packed, humorous and just plain unbelievable.<br /><br />I can't add much to my review that hasn't already been said, but I like this collector's edition. I liked the extras and I loved watching the finished product. Tom Hanks brought this character to life. This movie isn't a script. It's a story that Tom Hanks took control over. It's a part that he was born to play. And he played it to the hilt!<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved loved this movie!!!</p></br></body></html>
