I may check this out a fourth time, now that it's out on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The main role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.<br /><br />You would think a movie with this plot - the same day reoccurring day after day - would grow thin in a hurry but it doesn't. The screenwriters and actors all made it clever and fun to view each "new day."<br /><br /> All the characters from Murray to female lead Andie MacDowell to the supporting actors do a great job of keeping the story fresh. Particularly funny was Stephen Tobolowsky, who portrays a nerdy insurance salesman. I liked Marita Geraghty, too, and it was fun to see Rick Ducommun again, my favorite actor from "The 'burbs."<br /><br />For a modern-day comedy, the language in here is very mild. The only drawback was seeing MacDowell's character compromise her wholesome values at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I remember when this came out.  Bill was on "GMA" & did the weather.<br /><br />Funny, original film.  You wish comedies were ALL like this.<br /><br />Bill did a great job as Phil.  All the things he did in the film as February 2 kept repeating.<br /><br />Harold in his bit part as the doctor.  Another cameo by Willie Garson  (Stanford from Sex & the City, There's Something About Mary).<br /><br />Decent extras on the DVD.<br /><br />BUT, an anniversary edition?  Needed more.  Like.........<br /> NO CHAPTER LIST OR ANY INFORMATION INSIDE ON THE FILM.  The film was a hit & this is an anniversary release of it, how about something inside to read on the film?<br /><br />I did NOT care for the artwork on the front.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>So like this weatherman who thinks he knows which way the wind blows but isn't particularly interested and doesn't appreciate a rodent doing any predicting around him must conform to (or "embrace")the reality of a single dreaded day that he only wishes to escape from from the very start. He doesn't want to be where he is at all and doesn't like the people he is with. This single day becomes a prison for him from which there is no escape. He trys everything including suicide but everyday begins the same with him waking up in bed in a Bed and Breakfast to the same awful Sonny and Cher song "I Got You Babe" on the radio. Perhaps he is dead and in hell. Eventually after who knows how many repeats of this of this seeming glitch in spacetime he comes to accept his fate. He seizes the day, learns new skills, undergoes a personality change, and becomes the most totally engaged, positive and plugged in person to a point that is beyond belief superhuman. All this effort centers around hooking up with a lovely lady who he traveled into town with (What else but romantic love with change a western man trapped in a Hollywood plot). She of course remembers not a single thing each new day (I wonder what twisted notions could have gone through his mind). He in the end wins her heart and finding love with her is what ultimately frees him and he finally is allowed to begin a new day, the day after Groundhog Day. But now he loves the town and wants to stay there forever. He has changed and found true happiness and the very same place and people that were his personal hell are now his heaven. In the real world time stops for no man and you don't get countless repeats to get it right but who doesn't feel like they've had their share of Groundhog Days--just in the sense of being trapped having to deal with the same stuff day after day after day?? That's why the movie strikes a cord. And he self-improves, becomes a super friendly overachiever and gets the babe and Tony Robinson couldn't have outdone this fable.<br /><br />GROUNDHOG DAY is a unique movie, well written and directed, well cast, and Bill Murray gave a pitch perfect performance. The only way to avoid real life Groundhog Days is to live a lot more even while not having a lot of time; but don't worry about perfection or think it is romantic love that will save you..... that's TOO Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />This really is a classic film, if not a work of deep genius. Murray is as good as he gets, pretty much (though he was often that good in this era---Scrooged, Quick Change, What About Bob?); the script is tight and the premise is brilliant; Andie is at her least annoying; and above all GD is funny as hell at many points.<br />Worth rewatching every few years and/or whenever you need a feel-good romantic comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Harold Ramis's oddball comedy tracks a cynical meteorologist's hilarious efforts to free himself from a wormhole that's locked him into one of the dreariest days of his entire life. Murray's deadpan line reading and impeccable comic timing are what really make this such a cult favorite--especially as he devises various schemes to escape the temporal loop (including suicide!), and then decides to take a more productive tack. Chris Elliott, playing a dodo-brained camera operator, and sultry brunette MacDowell, the charming, cool-headed love interest, are wonderful as well. This is a fun, heady riff on petty misery that's tailor-made for Murray fans. Plus, you'll never hear Sonny and Cher's "I Got You, Babe" quite the same way again.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>One of Bill Murrays best.

Groundhog's Day just happens to be her birthday and she loves this movie! A smart funny romantic comedy with Murry at his comedic best. The supporting cast is excellent and there are many classic lines to quote in this top drawer comedy. The DVD is a good transfer on the regular edition and it does have some OK extra material. This should be in everyone's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>Everybody would probably like to re-live one day of his or her life. Everyone makes a mistake or two that they'd like to fix. But what if you had to live the same day over again, and again, and again, and again...?<p>Phil Connors goes through this strange cycle of life in &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; an undeniably strong comedy that features a great script and cast. It's like a Frank Capra story with sarcasm. And it works perfectly.<p>Bill Murray plays Connors with all the air of a frustrated cynical everyman who is fed up with his job and life. Phil is a weatherman for a local news station, and every year he goes to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the Punxsutawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out on February 2nd. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring. <p>Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.<p>Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. It happens every year, and this year should be no exception.<p>Keyword: Should.<p>Because this year isn't like most years. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Punxsutawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. <p>Again.<p>Waking up to the same Sonny and Cher song as the morning before, Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same, just as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday--again. Well, technically.<p>So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.<p>Part of what makes &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale &quot;A Christmas Story,&quot; which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called &quot;Scrooged.&quot;<p>But regardless, Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, &quot;I'm-smarter-than-you&quot; face. He considers himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.<p>Another thing that is great about &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck; never have bought a Ferrari, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash--it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (Although my conscience would still get in the way.) <p>There was a little comedy a few years ago that starred John Candy. The movie was named, &quot;Delirious,&quot; and it was about a soap opera writer who bumped his head and woke up trapped inside his own written world. And everything he would write on his typewriter came true. <p>I was reminded of that film while watching &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; which is undeniably a stronger comedy. While the movie &quot;Delirous&quot; was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control everything, and he didn't do them. I think that's where &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature.<p>In other words, I love watching characters on-screen giving in to the same human weaknesses that we all exhibit.<p>And that's exactly what Phil does in &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; And that is why, among other reasons, it is one of my favorite films.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>I thought Bill Murray was the perfect person to play this role, and I think its one of the funniest movies I have seen. The idea of having to live the same day over and over again is a great setting for Bill Murray's  talents to shine. I love all the situations he puts himself into, for  example the numerous suicide attempts and how he eventually learns anything  and everything about everyone in the entire town. If you haven't seen this  movie yet, definetly go check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Bill Murray's impeccable sense of timing, and Andie MacDowell's charm make this film of an egomaniacal weatherman caught in Time's revolving door one of the most fun-filled, comedies ever. Forced to relive the same miserable day over, and over, with consistantly hilarious changes that don't, at first, seem to be heading in any particular direction because there are no consequences for a man forced into this particular predicament, Bill's character ( Phil ) gradually begins to become human. The film is pure magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"The groundhog day" is a smart and very original urban fable. How would you react in case every day was a simple and monotonous repetition of the previous one?<br /><br />Bill Murray is superb as the anguished and hopeless weather showman and given the options, he experiments with the unexpected reactions of every single person who surround him.

Funny but smart. Masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Groundhog Day is Bill Murray's best film by some distance. It's a romantic comedy in disguise. However unlike a lot of romantic comedies it doesn't leave me wanting to throw-up in a bucket. Bill Murray plays Phil Conners a TV Weatherman man destined to re-live the same day over and over, and from the way it is depicted in the film, this happens literally thousands of times. Sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney the very cynical Phil can't believe it when he wakes the next morning to find its Groundhog Day again.....<br /><br />Many of the characters will live on with you after you have seen the film. Perhaps best of all is Ned Ryerson (brilliantly played by Stephen Tobolowsky) who Phil Conners meets every day over and over. He was someone Phil new at school, but now he's the Insurance salesman from hell. This a very funny film, I saw it at the Cinema two or three times and have enjoyed it every time since. There hasn't been a better comedy since it was made. For that matter I can't think of many better before it was made.<br /><br />The supporting cast are all good, and the extras on the DVD include a directors commentary, documentary as well as the usual trailers etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>Groundhog Day is based on what may be the oddest premise for a romantic comedy ever.  A TV news weatherman (Bill Murray) goes to Punxatawnee, PA to cover Groundhog Day.  The next day he wakes up and it is Groundhog Day again.  No one remembers that this day has already passed and so he is forced to live it again.  And the next day he wakes up and... it's Groundhog Day again.  And again... and again... and again... and, well, you get the idea.  Watching Murray's character go through this bizarre situation and the effect it has on him is absolutely riveting.  I love that no attempt to explain this time-loop is ever made, it's enough for the viewer to know that it is happening and we don't need to get bogged down in some geeky sci fi explanation.<br /><br />Bill Murray has a tendency to be a little too smug and over-the-top in his movie performances but he is at the top of his game here.  His timing is perfect and the role harnesses his smug and biting humor but this is tempered as the story progresses and Murray captures the nuances perfectly.  The rest of the cast similarly rises to the level of the unusually intelligent script.  For my money, this is probably the single best movie in the "romantic comedy" genre.  It is unique and perfectly executed.  Well worth watching whether you are a fan of Bill Murray or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is without a doubt, one of Bill Murray's best films. It is both a fantasy and a comedy flick. The basic premise of the film is simple. A man is forced to relive the same twenty four hours, over, and over, and over again, ad infinitum.<br /><br />Bill Murray is that man. An obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman, he is in Punxutawney, Pennsylvania to cover its Groundhog Day celebration, along with his beautiful and altruistic TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell, and his patient, long suffering cameraman, played by Chris Elliot. Murray, playing an uncaring, unfeeling wretch of a guy, is, for some inexplicable reason, forced to relive the same twenty four hours in Punxutawney over and over again. Why? Who knows and who cares? What follows next are some of the funniest moments in film.<br /><br />At first, Murray is confused. No one else, however, seems to be. As Murray continues to relive the same day, confusion turns to anger. Ultimately, that anger turns to mischieviousness and indulgence. After all, what would one do, if there were no consequences to one's actions?<br /><br />This premise provides for quite a few, very funny scenes. This puckish foray quickly denigrates into profound despair, as Murray realizes that he seems destined to relive the same day forever. Frequent, subsequent suicide attempts fail to stop the clock, and Murray rethinks his position. He concentrates , finally, on becoming the best man that he can be, with the lovely Andie MacDowell as his romantic interest.<br /><br />Murray's transition from smarm to charm provides for many hilarious scenes that will leave the viewer howling with laughter. The ultimate impact of his transition from Neanderthal man to Renaissance man is, needless to say, a positive one. This redemption will ultimately prove to be be Murray's salvation.<br /><br />Murray provides droll, comedic delivery, and he is perfect in this role. Andie MacDowell is the perfect straight man and comedic foil. Together they make this movie one that the viewer will want to see again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>Imagine someone who is a real self-centered jerk who suddenly gets caught in a time warp that causes him to repeat the same day over and over and over until he gets it right.  That is the fertile scenario that Bill Murray finds himself in when he wakes up repeatedly on Groundhog Day.  The first part of the movie sets the stage as we see Bill as a big-shot big-city weatherman trying to score with the young, attractive assistant producer.  They go to Puxsatawny, PA to cover the annual groundhog event along with their whimsical cameraman.  Things don't go well in his quest for seduction and he is shocked to discover that when he wakes up tommorrow it's yesterday.  There is a great deal of humor that comes from all of this as everybody does everything they did that day except our bewildered weatherman.  In time he discovers some advantages in this merry-go-round.  For example, he arranges to start taking piano lessons.  By the time it's all over, he has become quite the maestro though he has yet to reach tommorrow.  However, his repeated attempts to seduce the assistant producer keep coming up short.  He starts learning some important lessons about himself and others in this repetative day he's stuck in.  Though he improves so much as a person he is still stuck on what's best for him.  The moment he finally does something that's truly selfless, the next day arrives.  <p>I really enjoyed this movie and it is one of those movies that improves with each viewing.  I considered rating it higher but, apart from Bill Murray, the acting wasn't quite that spectacular.  It's a terrific movie for Bill Murray fans and it has a message that should appeal to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>When I first saw this movie, I could only think that it was incredibly stupid, but the second time, I saw that there is a very important message.<br />As the vain, conceited, ill-tempered and mean spirited weatherman, Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is forced to live each life day after day, in a type of private hell, we see how there is a spiritual message here.<br />We are all here to learn lessons and our dilemmas will continue to be repeated until we rectify our mistakes.<br />In a sense the same theme as the Scrooge story. Bill Murray was also superb in `Scrooged'!<br />A superb performance by Andie McDowell as the movie's leading lady.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>This is a great movie.  Bill Murray at his funniest.  And this new and improved DVD is a treat!  The first one was a &quot;bare-bones&quot; edition, with no special features.  This one is nowhere near the calibur of the latest &amp; greatest DVD's (Moulin Rouge, Episode I) as far as extra features go, but there is a great half-hour retrospective documentary featuring all the major players in this film except Bill Murray.  This movie was also one of the greatest romantic comedies (or pure comedies) of the past decade.  Bill Murray is dead-on as the weatherman who fancies himself a big-time talent and celebrity who gets stuck in a town because of a blizzard, only to be stuck there repeating the same day for seemingly forever.  I felt this movie did a great job exploring the progression of how a person would first exploit that type of situation, then get depressed by it, then accept it.  I definitely recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>I might be making a bold claim saying this is the best Bill Murray film of them all. Many people would call me on that with films that showcase his sophomoric hijinks like Stripes or Ghostbusters. Some may look at his more slightly more refined character works like What About Bob? and Scrooged as their hits. To me Groundhog Day tops them all. This is because not only do you have Bill Murray doing a perfect performance, but also because the content itself (and the writing behind it) takes this movie to the next level.<br /><br />Groundhog Day is a morality piece done in the vein of a classic Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode. I kind of "what if...?" sort of tale that puts a generally successful and selfish man (played by Murray) into a hopeless situation of never being able to escape a single day in a small town. On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over. However the further you go into the movie you get some true and believable character development. The fact Bill pulls it off convincingly as well as with his classic entertaining wit is what makes the movie shine.<br /><br />Don't think of the movie as just some lesson to learn and take with you. While it does have that they don't preach it to you. You figure the lessons out along with Phil (Murray), and that makes for a rather deep experience. The movie at its core is a comedy, and it's such a good comedy it's rating among the top comedies of all time by various film associations. It's not just a comedy either as it also has a healthy dose of romance in it. So much romance that it can pass off as a "chick flick" for those who are into that. So I guess you can say Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy/Twilight-Zonesque/morality play.<br /><br />The other actors do great as well, including co-star Andie MacDowell, supporting actors Chris Elliot (as the cameraman), Brian Doyle-Murray (mayor of the city) Stephen Tobolowsky (old high school associate) and others. The movie was directed by Murray's cohort in Ghostbusters and Stripes Harold Ramis, which makes me wonder if the role was made for Bill. Production itself is very solid. You won't find it winning awards for costumes, sets or special effects. At the same time you won't find any production values detracting from the story; they only serve to enhance it.<br /><br />This 15th Anniversary Edition will be digitally remastered (overseen by Ramis himself) and will include a host of special features including:<br /><br />- Commentary by director Harold Ramis (not sure if it's a new commentary or if it will be the same commentary from the last Special Edition DVD)<br /><br />- The Study of Groundhogs: A Real Life Look at Marmots<br /><br />- A Different Day: An Interview with Harold Ramis<br /><br />- Making of Documentary<br /><br />- Weight of Time documentary<br /><br />- Newly discovered deleted scenes<br /><br />The Weight of Time documentary was in the Special Edition DVD, but aside from that and the commentary this DVD has all new special features. The fact there are deleted scenes on this edition is enough to make me very curious on what we missed.<br /><br />This movie is a must have. Any Bill Murray fan should be required to see this movie. As far as which version to get I would say the 15th Anniversary Edition, at it is the best bang for your buck. If only they didn't use such an overly airbrushed picture for the cover. That is about the only thing about this DVD that stinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>I might be making a bold claim saying this is the best Bill Murray film of them all.

Some scenes are still a bit grainy and the color isn't as sharp as you find with newer movies on Blu-Ray. Then again this is a 15 year old movie. The Dolby 5.1 audio is the same as the previous 15th Anniversary DVD release. Then again the movie really wasn't meant to test your sound system. You get a lot of the same features as previous DVDs along with some new stuff. Here's a rundown:<br /><br />- Needle Nose Ned's Picture-in-Picture Track: Old Ned the insurance dude pops up in the movie from time to time with either some tidbits about the movie or asking you questions about the movie. This feature is a Blu-Ray exclusive.<br /><br />- Commentary by director Harold Ramis: It's the same one as the other DVDs. Informative in most places and a bit dull in others.<br /><br />- The Study of Groundhogs A Real Life Look at Marmots: It's virtually a mini-National Geographic special on groundhogs.<br /><br />- A Different Day: An Interview with Harold Ramis: This featurette has tons more information about the movie. Plus it's faster to sit through than the commentary.<br /><br />- Weight of Time documentary: Making of documentary with interviews of the cast and crew as well as some funny outtakes by Murray.<br /><br />- Deleted scenes: Six scenes that total out to about 5 1/2 minutes of footage. Most of the deleted scenes would have been nice to see on an extended mix. Although one 16 second deleted scene I am glad they did without.<br /><br />- BDLive: For those of you who actually care about this function. It's just a way for you to send content over to friends and stuff about the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a must have. Any Bill Murray fan should be required to see this movie. The Blu-Ray treatment is only a minor improvement to the previous 15th Anniversary DVD release, but it is a noticeable difference visually. Too bad they are still using the same butt-ugly airbrushed looking cover on the Blu-Ray disk. If you already have the 15th Anniversary DVD that was released earlier this year I don't know if the improvements are enough for the double (or triple) dip. If you have any version prior to that I would strongly recommend taking the plunge and go for the Blu-Ray (provided you have the high definition hardware for it).</p></br><a href="../users/A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D.html">A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D</a><br/><p>This is without a doubt the best film I have seen starring Bill Murray.

This comedy came in under the radar-it was not a big hit, but it has the stars and script that should have made it one.  Bill Murray is PERFECT for this part, and any collection of his classic film lines, from GHOSTBUSTERS and CADDYSHACK thru the present would have to include at least a couple of the following from this film:<p>&quot;I'm guessing March 22nd.&quot;<br />&quot;I'd love to stay and talk...but I'm not going to.&quot;<br />&quot;I'm BOTH!  I'm a celebrity in an emergency!&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah, they're hicks Rita.&quot;<br />&quot;Morons!  Your bus is leaving.&quot;<br />&quot;Well what if there IS NO TOMORROW!?  THERE WASN'T TODAY!  Hello?&quot;<p>I can't say much for the special edition treatment-there isn't really anything here to speak of.  Commentary is nice, but it's obvious that not too much time or effort was put into this.  The film looks good and sounds good and that's all I really care about.  If you have passed over this film year after year in the video store-try it.  It takes a hardened man and redeems him by the end!  Very uplifting and funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>Hard to believe it has been fifteen years since this comedy classic was released.  Fortunately GROUNDHOG DAY is standing the test of time and is still one of the funniest films ever made. If you don't know the premise Bill Murray stars as an obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman who resents almost everything about his job and especially his annual trip to small town Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog Day festival there.  After behaving abominably to his producer(Andie MacDowell), cameraman (Chris Elliot) and all the small town folk there a blizzard comes in and closes all the roads out of Punxsutawney putting Bill in panic stricken sarcasm overdrive.  But the blizzard is the least of his problems.  Bill finds by some magical time loop he has to keep repeating February 2 until he gets it right.  Highly recommended though I will warn you I had the tune to Pennsylvania Polka in my head for several days after watching this.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>Irritable? Frustrated? Bored or depressed? Here's the cure; in an unassuming comedy about Murray's Phil Conners, the Weatherman, who solves those problems when he relives the same day over and over. Seminal film transcends comedy, romance, fantasy and  spirituality; working as an attitude adjuster filled with healthy belly laughs. Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and twice Murrays are shining with every extra.<br />If you had a day to live ; would you be very good or very bad? Phil tries it all; for worse and better. This is a Sci-fi Horror, Comedy Drama with a boogaloo beat and it will aid in all moods.<br /><br />Recommended dose: 1-2 a year.<br />BD is full strength. All versions are OK. BD better, clear and powerful. Best taken with a meal.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>In honor of today actually being Groundhog Day, I thought I'd write this review. This movie is very funny. Bill Murray stars as a self-centered TV meteorologist named Phil Connors. After dissing his assignment and his crew, he finds that he keeps living the same day over and over again. Will this make Phil learn his lesson and teach him the error of his ways? I highly recommend GROUNDHOG DAY!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I happen to find Bill Murray utterly hysterical, when he's in the right movie.  If he is not in the right film I find him excruciating.  While I can't say that `Groundhog Day' is a completely realized concept (there was so much more that could have been done here) I can honestly say that Murray's transformation as Phil Connors is a completely realized performance.  He is quite possibly at his very best here (his `Lost in Translation' stint is still his finest work to date) and evokes enough human feeling to make Phil a very real, a very relatable and in the end a very honest portrait of the average American male.<br /><br />The film focuses on Phil, a weatherman for a Pittsburgh news station who has to travel to Punxatawney to cover Groundhog Day, when Punxatawney Phil comes out to see his shadow.  Phil is a cynical mess who loathes his life and his stagnant attitude towards those around him makes him somewhat of a bother.  No one wants him around and he doesn't really want anyone else around either.  When Phil, his producer Rita and their cameraman Larry find themselves trapped in Punxatawney during a blizzard it seems as though their trip couldn't get any worse, but for Phil it was just about to hit the fan.  Phil wakes up the next morning to find out that it is yesterday, Groundhog Day, yet again.<br /><br />Talk about Deja vu.<br /><br />What's worse is that the next morning it happens again; and again and again.  So what would you do if you could relive the same day over and over without any consequences or repercussions.  Phil at first begins to use it for his own selfish gain (learning about pretty women so as to seduce them) which only leads to his own self hatred and thus moves him to attempt unsuccessful suicides; but when Phil finally realizes that this could all serve to make him a better more fulfilled person things start to change and the cynical mess he used to be begins to strip itself away to reveal a kinder more human side to him.<br /><br />Really, `Groundhog Day' is about taking advantage of the chances we have for self improvement.  There are two types of selfishness; the malicious and self-congratulating kind that only leads to hurt feelings and loneliness; and then there is the kind that leads to self betterment and awareness.  Phil learns to differentiate between the two, becoming selfish for his own good; learning to love himself and thus become a better more fulfilled human being.<br /><br />Murray is phenomenal here, and he needs to be since he is in every scene practically and this he carries this entire film.  His comedic timing is priceless, but it is the warmth he brings to his character; the tragic realism he gives Phil that makes his so much more relatable.  I wish they had cast someone other than Andie MacDowell though.  I find her dreadfully boring most times, and here she fails to really make Rita someone we would fall in love with.  She pretty much plays the same character she did in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' except we see much more of her here, which strips away the mystery that surrounded her equally boring yet much more intriguing character in `Four Weddings' and leaves us with a dreadfully uninteresting creation.<br /><br />I do wish that this film had taken a different direction as far as genre is concerned, because it has all the makings for an intelligent adult character study, along the lines of say `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or even Murray's own `Lost in Translation'; but instead, targeting a younger audience, the film winds up feeling like a standard comedy a lot of the time, which takes away from the promise of the premise.  It isn't a bad film AT ALL, but there is potential here for a much deeper and much more meaningful film.  Regardless, it is still a film to see, and Murray gives an Oscar worthy performance as the man we all may end up being if we don't learn now how to find fulfillment.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>a middle aged man's coming of age story.  watching this movie with adult eyes, i was struck by the detailed structure.  bill is already repeating a groundhog's day his whole life, an empty existence.  at first, that's how interprets and exploits his new existence, through empty gluttony.<br />then he takes the challenge of seducing andie, but it's not love.  then he goes through depression and torments, negating his existence thru suicide attempts.  finally, he accepts his fate, and looks to enrich himself thru literature, music, and art, while at the same time reaching out to others and becoming fully human. thru this process, he naturally wins the heart of andie, as he becomes a man, one willing to give and not only receive.<br /><br />the gift is that this story is told with so much humor, that one doesn't realize the structured details at first.  although there are some rough spots, it is highly crafted and tells an intricate story upon inspection and reflection.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Bill Murray has done many funny films "The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997)" and many profound films "The Razor's Edge" (1984).

The tone of the movie is set so right with Bill Murray as Phil. He is in his element. The movie is hilarious, but Phil does a great job of reenacting his days over and over and over again. This movie was released a long time ago, but the dvd sales rank is 431. That is still pretty high considering how old this movie is. <p>The real thing that catches my interest with this film is the way it conveys drama, yet is uplifting. Although Phil runs into some tear-jerker moments that make you feel sad, the movie truly uplifts your heart in the end and makes you feel great. I have seen countless movies that were dramas, and they left me feeling depressed. I really love how Phil starts to realize that you have to make the best of things.<p>The movie is really great. I can't understand why this movie would receive a negative review. Each day is truly interesting considering you have seen it, but Phil changes his routines, and changes a great deal over the course of the film. 5 stars. I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to feel good.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>Phill Conners (Bill Muary) is a TV wheaterman that is assigned to cover the Groundhog Day holiday.

Bill Murray is at his best as Phil Conners, a man stuck in Groundhog Day, taking his comedic routines to new heights and making the film rib-ticklingly funny. Both Murray and Ramis haven't found something as good as this since, especially Murray, whos'e wide comedic abilities are wasted in films like Charlie's Angels.

But, what if you were given not only one chance, but three then four. Slightly drastic? <p>What if you lived every day over and over again until you had achieved the mission of that day. Confusing? (I always say that when I get jumbled.) Well, don't be confused. If I was in the position to relive my life, knowing what I know now, by jove I think I would be a tad more towards the bright side. (As Monty said) It is true that this is a comedy, because you wonder as time goes by, &quot;When will it all end!&quot; <p>The character Murray plays is a perfect one for him. Someone who thinks they have it all together, then when they take a second look, then a fourth, realizes he is really more in the dark than he ever expected.

But "Groundhog Day" was a great Bill Murray film - with a moral even!<br /><br />Murray plays a weatherman Phil Connors on a local Pennsylvania TV station who is assigned to do an on-the-scene standup. To his dismay, it is at unveiling of Punxatony Phil - the groundhog who predicts whether spring is imminent or 6 weeks away. Phil is a narcissistic twit, who feels the assignment is beneath him. But his snarkiness is put on hold when he gets the hots for on-location producer Rita (Andy McDowell). Andy is a very nice lady who sees right through Murray. No chance the two of them will end up together.<br /><br />A blizzard forces an overnight stay. But when Phil wakes up, he discovers that it is still February 2! It takes Phil several cycles to really believe that he is reliving precisely the same day. AT which time he does what every egomaniac would do: he tries to takes advantage of this situation. He scores with attractive women (after learning their likes and dislikes in previous lives), and otherwise tries to enrich himself. But Rita, his real quarry, is nowhere near his net.<br /><br />Telling more would ruin the film. Suffice it to say that Phil gets tired of his repetitive victories, and undergoes a Scroogelike metamorphosis. Kudos to writer/producer Harold Ramis for sneaking this cute morality take onto our radar. And for making it real. Which of us, when realizing, in a dream, that we are dreaming, does not try to use that knowledge for self-gratification of self-improvement? Ramis has taken that common experience and run it to it logical conclusion. A terrific film with brains, heart and soul.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell star in this 1993 Harold<br />Ramis comedy.

It provides fertile ground for a romantic comedy as well.  Bill Murray is a self-important weatherman who finds himself reliving Groundhog Day.  He goes through a number of stages, from disbelief through near-insanity to a calm acceptance, growing as a person along the way.  As much as I liked the concept and Bill Murray's performance, I found myself growing bored toward the end of the film.  Of course, repetition is unavoidable in a film of this type.  Indeed, it is the whole point of the movie.  Nevertheless, the filmmakers needed to make the repetition seem a little less...well, repetitious.  I still give it three stars, but screenwriter Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis needed to find more for the actors to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Yes, this is an entertaining movie, very well made, and has a lot of funny variables on the recurring events of GROUNDHOG DAY.  Murray is good in his role; Andie McDowell even better.  But I can't call it a &quot;classic&quot; because there are times when enough is enough.  With no explanation for the time warp or its resolution, it's hard to understand just why Bill is reliving each day.  Even as the story progresses and Bill finally becomes a decent, caring man, we've had to wade through a lot of redundancy that the screenplay didn't necessitate.  But I'd be a Scrooge to say it isn't a happy entertainment.  Some of the supporting characters in Puxta..whatever? are fun, and it's unique the way director Harold Ramis alters some of the recurring scenes, especially obnoxious Stephen Tobolowsky's, Hi I'm (I've forgotten his name already).<br />Admittedly enjoyable, but not the &quot;best comedy ever!&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Phil Connors, a cynical and unbearable journalist goes like every year in a small town in Pennsylvania to report on "Groundhog Day", it means the beginning of spring.

We just saw it in 2005, 13 years after its original release. And that says a lot about how timeless it is: how much it can work regardless of the time you watch it.<br /><br />The bottom line of the movie is fairly basic, when you first think of it: Bill Murray, who plays the role of a news weatherman from Pittsburg, is off to cover Groundhog Day once more, an event he's had more of than he can stomach. After the day is over, every day from then on, starts to repeat the exact same Groundhog Day, over and over. This gives him time to look deep inside himself after numerous failed attempts of "escaping" the time loop, and perfect things from saying the right things to everyone (including his new producer, played by beautiful Andie Macdowell) to becoming an accomplished ice sculptor and piano player, and even attempting to save the lives of those doomed to have an accident and/or die that day.<br /><br />His evolution as a person and the way he begins to see things in a different light as new Groundhog Days keep coming at him once and again is enlightening. At the end, it's more than just a feel-food romantic comedy. It poses some interesting and significant questions for us to ponder: What would you do, if you could live a day over and over indefinitely? What would you make of it? To me, alongside "Lost in Translation" it easily ranks as Bill Murray's best movie, and overall, it's become one of my favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is without a doubt, one of Bill Murray's best films. It is both a fantasy and a comedy flick. The basic premise of the film is simple. A man is forced to relive the same twenty four hours, over, and over, and over again, ad infinitum. <p>Bill Murray is that man. An obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman, he is in Punxutawney, Pennsylvania to cover its Groundhog Day celebration, along with his beautiful and altruistic TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell, and his patient, long suffering cameraman, played by Chris Elliot. Murray, playing an uncaring, unfeeling wretch of a guy, is, for some inexplicable reason, forced to relive the same twenty four hours in Punxutawney over and over again. Why? Who knows and who cares? What follows next are some of the funniest moments in film.<p>At first, Murray is confused. No one else, however, seems to be. As Murray continues to relive the same day, confusion turns to anger. Ultimately, that anger turns to mischieviousness and indulgence. After all, what would one do, if there were no consequences to one's actions? <p>This premise provides for quite a few, very funny scenes. This puckish foray quickly denigrates into profound despair, as Murray realizes that he seems destined to relive the same day forever. Frequent, subsequent suicide attempts fail to stop the clock, and Murray rethinks his position. He concentrates , finally, on becoming the best man that he can be, with the lovely Andie MacDowell as his romantic interest.<p>Murray's transition from smarm to charm provides for many hilarious scenes that will leave the viewer howling with laughter. The ultimate impact of his transition from Neanderthal man to Renaissance man  is, needless to say, a positive one.  This redemption will ultimately prove to be be Murray's salvation. <p>Murray provides droll, comedic delivery, and he is perfect in this role. Andie MacDowell is the perfect straight man and comedic foil. Together they make this  movie one that the viewer  will want to see again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Usually I'm a stickler for wanting to know the how and the why of things.  Like: Why is this happening to Phil?  How is this happening?  However, this is one of those rare times when you just go with it and draw your own conclusions-and it works.  Don't ask me how.  But everything about this movie, from the writing to casting, is just dead on perfect.  What would you do if there was literally no tomorrow?  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>In Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude.<br /><br />I love this movie - not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away - they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing?<br /><br />Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>"Groundhog Day" is a classic if there ever was one. Featuring a 100 % perfect performance from the one and only Bill Murray, a strong, well written plot and loads of laugh, this is a true classic.<br /><br />Murray plays the acerbic, insulting, and overall rude weatherman Phil Connors. Along with his obsessively perky producer (Andie McDowell) and his smartass cameraman (Chris Elliot), he journeys to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. When a snowstorm hots, Phil is forced to spend the night. But when he wakes up the next morning, Phil realizes he is experiencing Groundhog Day once again, and again, again, and again...until he finally gets it right.<br /><br />This heartwarming movie is filled with laughs as well as a great message. This special edition comes with a documentary, adduio commentary by director Harold Ramis, and great remastered sound and picture quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>As close as a comedy can come to resembling a riveting suspense thriller without any murders or misdemeanours but a simple, engrossing premise -- a weather man caught up in a circadian cycle and having to relive variations of same moments with the same people around him.<br /><br />  How easily this could have imploded into insipid ideas but Groundhog Day succumbs to none of them. Danny Rubin's crisp writing comes up with a plenty of subtle swerves on the same encounters, mining new laughs out of Murray, who is not just great, he literally yanks the movie to life with his delirious impulses and effortless improvisation.<br /><br />  Best bit, apart from being the hilarious caper it is, the movie also couches a beautiful dynamic. Our quirky weatherman begins as a grouch, but through his existential tapeloop (the movie doesn't hint how many times he goes through it, but the crafts he picks up along the way suggest a number in the hundreds at the least) he undergoes a redemption that implies how we can, through sheer purity of intent and determination, get out of our respective ruts and make meaningful contributions to the world.<br /><br />  My humble suggestion: stop reading and get down to watching this all-time classic, pronto, on your own DVD disc, which will undoubtedly be one of your most prized possessions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>Right up there with "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" and "There's Something About Mary" there's my favorite Billy Murray comedy.... "Goundhog Day". Murray (as TV Weatherman Phil Connors) is easily the movie's lone Hollywood star, as the rest of the cast are much lesser known in the field. Andie MacDowell was probably better known for her career in modeling in 1993, than as an actress... she does a simply wonderful job as "Rita" the TV Producer. Chris Elliot does a fine job in a less annoying role than he's used to as "Larry" the cameraman (he's come a long way since being "The Man Under The Stairs" on David Letterman). The other actor to really make an impression is the man with the recognizable face, but what's his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned "Bing!" Ryerson). Oh, and Scooter the groundhog. As for the story, Bill Murray is stuck in the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA covering the now famous festivities. He keeps reliving the same day, over and over again. Everyday he sees the same things. Everyday he meets the same people... the man in the hallway early in the morning, Doris the waitress, the town mayor, etc. He decides to make the best of the situation and do whatever he wants... only because he knows he'll wake up the next day and it will be the same day all over again. As he grows tired of reliving the same day over and over, Connors shifts his focus to Rita. First, trying to impress her. Then, trying to really care for her. When he finally does break thru to her, the spell is broken and the next day appears. I rank some of Bill Murray's movies as classic... i.e. "Caddyshack", "Stripes", "Scrooged", "What About Bob", etc... but I put "Groundhog Day" at the top of the list. Easy choice for my #1 favorite Bill Murray movie. Also an easy pick for one of my top 4-5 comedies all-time. *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that I watched once and thought, &quot;Jeez, that was fun.&quot; I watched it again with some friends and caught all sorts of extra things. Each time I watch it, it gets funnier and funnier!<p>You have the take the whole thing as a fun campy movie. Bill Murray is great as his character goes from egocentric weatherman to caring individual. Sure, this bizarre timewarp just &quot;appears&quot;. Sure, much of Bill's motivation to change is that he just wants to escape the warp, not that he (at least initially) really cares about the people he's helping. But it's all in fun, and the bizarre things that go on are hilarious.<p>There isn't any great redemption in the movie, or mystic message ... it's simply a lot of fun to watch, to catch all the subtle ways things change as the day continually loops back into itself for Bill. If you ever feel like you're stuck in a rut, this is the perfect movie to help you laugh your way out!</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Until last weekend, I'd never seen Groundhog Day. I'd also seen hardly any of it on television. But of course I knew what it was about. The film has its own place in pop culture and is always included in a discussion of great comedy films. Groundhog Day, featuring Bill Murray in his prime, is about Phil Connors, a cocky arrogant weatherman, that travels to watch the yearly ritual of the groundhog, his shadow, and the coming of spring. Phil brings along his photographer, Larry (Chris Elliot), and his producer Rita (Andie McDowell). They are both subject to Phil's selfish actions throughout the day.<br /><br />Then, Phil wakes up to the same music as the day before. He soon realizes everything is the same. He is reliving Groundhog Day again. By now, even if you've never seen the movie, you know what the plot is. Yet, you are in for a great surprise. Phil relives Groundhog Day hundreds of times, and each time, Rita, Larry and the townspeople are living the day as if it is their first.<br /><br />Phil goes through several stages, from cynical amusement at the prospects of living the day over, to using his knowledge to take advantage of strangers, to total despair at the prospects of stuck in the endless loop of time. Eventually, Phil changes in a heartwarming way and the movie ends happily.<br /><br />This kind of movie would never be made today. Its pace is slow and deliberate, yet full of laughs. It isn't raunchy and doesn't try to get away with stuff. The movie treats the viewers with respect. It never explains why Phil keeps reliving the days, nor does it ever explain why he stops. Just like everything else in life, it just happens. I'm sorry it took me so long to watch this pleasant movie from 1993. If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely check out this classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Groundhog Day - 15th Anniversary Edition is the perfect film to watch when you are in a funk. Hopefullly this hit film will put a smile on your face afterwords, Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are heavenly together. They have great chemistry and you believe their love/hate relationship. This is director's Harold Ramis second best film after National Lampoon's Vacation, I just love his movies. I highly recommend purchasing this classic, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>No one invented quite such an original premise as is depicted in this movie.<br /><br />And it works great as a chaser after seeing "I Heart Huckabees."  It's every bit as existential, and frames a proposition for personal growth out of a nightmarish stagnation as compared to the complete freedom of time enjoyed by the "Huckabees" folks.<br /><br />No matter where you go, there you are.  Each film says that it is up to us to make something better.  This film says that once you get to a place of generosity, other-centeredness and relentless good will, you can be redeemed - if only to figure out anew what to do with all the time we've been given.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>One of my favorite multiple-watching films.  I don't even want to argue whether the film is important or not, great or not, or whatever or not.  It is a fun film with a pleasant love story and is full of actors I really enjoy watching.  The love story is fun because it is the mirror of the normal film love story.  Typically the girl hates the guy but she slowly changes to see what a great guy he is and finally falls for him.  Here, Rita (Andie MacDowell - in one of my favorite of her performances) remains the same and it is Phil (Bill Murray - one of his great roles) who slowly learns who he needs to be to win Rita over and finally becomes that person.<br /><br />While everyone knows the plot of the story by now, I don't want to give it away to the three people left who don't know it.  Just let me say that unless you think funny movies cannot have a kind soul, you will like this movie.  Frankly, I get awfully tired of the oceans of howling venom passing for wit.  This is a movie I am willing to watch anytime at the drop of a hat.  There are so many funny scenes, but the image of Bill Murray giving driving instructions to a groundhog as the flee from panicked townsfolk is wonderful.<br /><br />Enjoy it!</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Phil Conors ( Bill Murray) is a TV weatherman that is rude, conceited, and full of himself. Every year he gets stuck having to go to Punxsutawney, Pensylvania to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. Going with him this year is his sexy and cheerful producer Rita ( Andie McDowell), and his smart-mouthed, yet somewhat nerdy camera man Larry ( Chris Elliot). Phil wants to get out of town as soon as possible, but is snowed in when an unexpected blizzard hits. But things are about to get even worse. Phil wakes up the next morning to discover that it's Groundhog Day all over again. He is forced to live the same day over and over. But the more Phil is forced to repeat it, the more he comes to care about the town and those around him. But life really starts to get complicated when he finds himself falling for Rita. <p>"Groundhog Day" is one of the funniest and most original films ever made. Bill Murray has made a lot of outstanding films. But in my opinion, "Groundhog Day" is his best one. The repeating day is amazingly done. All of the actors do an extremely good job making each day look the same. The laughs that this film brings are non-stop. I even found myself rewinding scenes for a second and third viewing at times. Bill Murray is amazing as Phil Connors. Watching him play both roles is great. The first being the one who hates everybody and only cares about himself. Watching him try to kill himself over and over will make you laugh extremely hard. The other is the one that adjusts to live in Punksatawney and learns to care about those around him. No matter what he does, he will make you laugh. Andie McDowell is great as Rita. Her sweet and caring nature works well against Murray's negative attitude. The chemistry between her and Murray is amazing. One of the best romance stories I have ever seen. However, my favorite character was Stephen Tobolowsky's Ned Rierson. Every different time Ned and Phil meet, provides for the funniest scenes in the film. "Ned, I'd love to stay here and talk with you. But I'm not going to." Chris Elliot and the rest of the town are also all outstanding. <p>No matter how many times you see this film, you will never find it boring, repetitive, or less funny. In fact, you laugh harder with each viewing. The story, romance between Phil and Rita, and the great all around acting make Groundhog Day one of the best comedies ever made. The DVD is great, and the documentary : "The Weight of Time", is worth the price alone</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Groundhog Day is the funniest movie of the 90's. Brilliant performance by Bill Murray who plays a cocky weatherman Phil Connors who covers Groundhog day every year in the small town of Punxatawnee that he hates. The day end with him being stuck there because of a blizzard that he didn't predict...and what more, he relives groundhog day over and over again...taking advantage of it, taking his own life, making a move on his producer Andie Macdowell which turns out to be his first lesson in reviewing his inner cruelty and becoming a better person, and a local hero!<p>This movie is straight out funny...it will make you crack up with every viewing. Watch out for Stephen Tobolowski in his bizarre role as Ned Ryerson, and a cameo appearance by the film's director (and Murray's costar in Ghostbusters) Harold Ramis.<p>The features are well worth the money too.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>I have seen most of Bill Murray's films and I generally love most of them. With all of those great films, I consider Groundhog Day his best and it is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. Bill Murray is at his greatest in this movie because herein he channels all of his talent into the role of Phil the jaded and bitter weather man from a Pittsburgh tv station.<br />The story is a simple one of redemption and changing the path one's life is on and Murray takes this relatively simple and perhaps predictable plot line and delivers a charming and engaging performance that is never maudlin, never exaggerated and never phony. As the repetition of the day continues, Murray's Phil transforms from frightened non-believer, to scheming opportunist, to crazed suicidal maniac, and finally to a man who finally understands why this bizarre circumstance is happening to him. The movie is never heavy-handed or preachy. It is subtle, introspective, and genuine. This is a perfect vehicle for both the earlier Stripes version of Bill Murray as well as the latter day one that did so well in Lost in Translation. This gem is truly one of those eternal movies that can be watched for generations to come as you do with the really great ones. Like the crazed reality of Phil's situation, Groundhog Day can be experienced over and over and over again and always satisfy.<br />Groundhog Day is a movie that touches your soul as well as your funny bone, and makes you feel alive and inspired. How many movies do that and are this heartwarming and fun?<br />As for special features, I buy dvds because I want to see the movie, not because I want to watch a bunch of interviews, play games with my dvd remote control, or listen to commentaries. If they are there and they are worthwhile, so much the better, but if they are not, I still am glad I own the movie and the lack of special features would never alter my decision to buy a movie. Groundhog Day is worth owning in whatever format you can find it. Just thought I'd throw that out there....</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I watched this movie last night (on Groundhog Day, of course!) because it's one of my all-time faves, and always a treat. I loved it when I first saw it in the theater, and I've watched it three or four times now. Each time, I notice more tidbits that just add to the wonderfulness.<p>I won't go into details about the storyline, as others have already done so. However, I will note that not only is the script clever and Bill Murray's performance terrific, but the structure and pacing of the movie are almost perfect. Each time you go &quot;around the loop&quot; you get just enough new information to follow the story as new elements are introduced. There's not a wasted moment in the whole movie.<p>I know it's a cliche.... but I'd have to say that if you could only buy 10 movies to watch over and over again, this should be one of them.  It's that good, and it holds up that well. Think of it as a modern-day &quot;It's A Wonderful Life.&quot;</p></br></body></html>
